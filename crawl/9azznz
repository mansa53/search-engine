{"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9azznz/are_my_goals_realistic/", "text": "I've had enough of doing pointless job applications related to my field. I've tried applying to countless entry-level positions, and several tries at mid/junior level jobs. This went on for a year and a half already. Finished my degree in Applied ~~motherfcking~~ Physics in a premier university in my country, but jokes on me. I've even applied to a janitorial vacancy since I'm getting frustrated of just lazying around at home when I'm already 23. \n\nSo I decided to just switch to a programming career. Most of the job postings (in my field) that I decided not to apply to, had a requirement for programming experience. I'm not new to programming, but I don't have a portfolio or work experience. Have taken 3 programming electives during college, and also an Intro course on ComSci. Been studying for a month now - youtube tutorials, some ebooks, codecademy, freecodecamp, etc. etc. etc., and of course, practice. \n\nI'm focusing now on HTML, would then continue to CSS and Javascript. Planning to work on my own website ASAP, but this would be for my mother's plant business - just a static website. Would be a part of my portfolio, too. After that, gonna re-study Python (practiced some programming by myself during college, forgot most of it already). I'm targeting to work on an open source project, or get a paid/unpaid internship by first quarter next year, or maybe a year from now. Does this sound too farfetched? If yes, then what advice could you give me?\n\nBTW, I'm studying/practicing about 8 hours each day. I don't play fortnite, so I could probably pump those numbers up.\n", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Sure, it's possible. ", "id": "e4zaar2", "replies": []}], "title": "Are my goals REALISTIC?"}
