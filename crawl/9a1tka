It took so long to install and try to run a demo matrix multiplication and eventually that failed after much troubleshooting.\n\nSo my interest died as I got busy but now as I reinstalled my OS and again CUDA 9.2 will not install as my visual studios auto-updated somehow and I am looking into other parallel/GPU computing tools that will work on my cards. \nIs PyCUDA this painful too?\n\nCan I use CUDA on something basic like CodeBlocks?\n\nSo with the reading I have done I still cannot figure out if OpenCL will work and is worth diving into.\n\nWill I be able to use CUDA or OpenCL in a linux distro that is not a massive time suck to configure?\n\nI love the idea of open source and something like Vulkan needs devs so someday that would be cool\n\nIf you can answer any of my questions then many thanks", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "You can use OpenCL on Linux. \n\nCodeBlocks is just an IDE. I'm sure you can use it with CUDA. I spent a whole internship writing OpenCL with Vim, so it's not like these things require heavy IDEs.
