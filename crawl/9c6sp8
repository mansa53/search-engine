I am facing the following problem:\n\nI have one Sheet with The Columns Name and ID:\n\nName|ID|\n:--|:--|\nExample|20|\n\nAnd another One with just one cell looking like this:\n\nCell with ID, Item, Number|                   \n:--|\n20, 33, 500|\n20, 34, 500|\n20, 35, 250|\n\nIn Java I have all the prices as floats. In the end, I need to create text like this:\n\n    Float priceOfExample = price[33] * 500 + price[34] * 500 + price[35] * 250\n\nNow yeah, this works manually, but I'm doing this for lots of items. So I want a way to do this quicker. And Android applications aren't the right way to handle this. What language (or whatever else you can recommend me) is good for producing this code segment out of the data I have? I currently use Sublime text with replace and multiple cursors, but I don't think that's the most efficient way.", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "Where are these spreadsheets coming from?  For file format are they?  If they are both, or can be converted to csv (the second one looks like csv data that all got read as a single cell by the spreadsheet program.  Then it would be very easy to work with in pretty much any language.  I would just use java since it's what you already know so you can probably work best with it and it's as good as any other language.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy are you generating code for this?  You could just have the processing code load the data from the file directly instead of having to hard code everything into the java code.  This way you can change the data file without needing to change your program.", "id": "e58i2lo", "replies": [{"body": "An excel file and an csv document, so yeah. Ok, so Java can be used just as well as python? \n\nI'm also looking for something more general, regardless of the spreadsheets. Just when I have a pile of code and I want to do some general operations on it, no matter what type of file data comes from, or even if it's just copy pasted numbers from somewhere.\n\nAlso, I'm generating code because as I said, I'm working in Android Studio and I don't think including the whole file is worth it. Hardcoding it just seems like the better solution, and I hope it will end up less messier than if I pull it out of files. Also, the data will never change.", "id": "e58iutr", "replies": [{"body": "Java, Python, or pretty much any other language would be good for this.

Or maybe I might use SQL since it's rows of columnar data with different tables related to each other. Or a spreadsheet using equations and its native scripting language (VBA for Excel). All depends on what the goal is and what mood I'm in.\n\nBut in this case, probably SQL for all the heavy lifting. This would be *really* easy to do with a select over a few joined tables.\n\nJava would be fine though.", "id": "e58kbnw", "replies": []}, {"body": "Hard code it as a 2 dimensional array literal.", "id": "e59guqi", "replies": []}], "title": "What's the best way to manipulate text?"}
