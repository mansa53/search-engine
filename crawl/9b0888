It's very small (10 users) and I am hoping to get more people in to make it more efficient. Nothing has happened as of yet, but we are hoping to make a useful server. If you like this idea, please upvote and check it out yourself! (Right now it's for Python, but if more people join, we will add support for as much as we can!\n\nHere's the invite link:\n\n[https://discord.gg/e4cevW2](https://discord.gg/e4cevW2)", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "Just so you know, there's also /u/IslandIdealist\n's Discord server. Invite link: https://discord.gg/9zT7NHP\n\nIt's the semi-official LearnProgramming discord, but is it's own separate entity.", "id": "e4zd6pu", "replies": [{"body": "I didn't say this, but it's quite important, it's more focused on simply *debugging*,quickly, so that the process is streamlined. Yes I want it to grow, but I don't want it to be too big, as that would defeat its purpose. It's just to get on and find a quick answer. I've been on these massive servers with thousands of people and it's just too fast for people to see your problem. Not to say that they're bad, they're great for talking, but the debugging aspect is just an extra feature, and those channels are usually full of tons of people. That's just me though.", "id": "e4zdxkj", "replies": [{"body": "Debugging is probably 80% of being a developer and if you're trying to cheat yourself out of the growing pains it'll only hurt you in the long run.

It's especially hard for people learning their first language and/or learning by themselves, and can make learning feel frustrating and useless. I speak from experience. Yes, maybe in some occasions, it can stop you from learning some parts, but having other people to help you can teach you new things as well. It's not so clear cut.", "id": "e4zj0go", "replies": [{"body": "I can only speak from my experience, but figuring out something you've been debugging for days is the best high I've ever experienced.
