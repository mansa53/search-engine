They're helpful for different situations.\nOther is to install plugins like: file icons, themes, file browser themes etc. \n\nIf you work with files without saving them(quick testing), then you can find an icon at the bottm of editor where you select languages for syntax highlighting.\n\nThe code writing experiance can be enhanced by adding a bit of delay when your keystrokes are registered. This will be similar to the 'smooth cursor' or 'smooth display' effect you get on MS Word software. It looks appealing when writing the code and also makes you really view your own code while typing.\n\nSplit screen option is useful when working with multiple languages as an internconnected work. For example: Editing HTML and it's referenced CSS file side by side for more productivity & less errors.\n\nThere is an option to view terminal and also type commands. Good for developers who work with command line.", "id": "e57nypa", "replies": [{"body": "How do you add the delay when key strokes are registered?

Basically you place all your files in a folder and open that folder up in Sublime so you can edit the files. Then you'll use a tool (google local web server, there are tons of options) to host that folder like a website only you can see, usually accessed by going to localhost:8080 in a browser. So you'll edit in Sublime, save, then navigate to a browser and refresh the page to see the changes. Use Chrome or Firefox and also have the dev tools open so you can debug faster. There's a tool called MAMP for creating a local web server that has a free version, is pretty straightforward, and works on PC and Mac.", "id": "e57tfba", "replies": []}, {"body": "> Is this the best way to code using Sublime Text or is there a better way?\n\nI would suggest you use Visual Studio Code for writing code.
