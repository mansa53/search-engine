{"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9ap0fw/my_tips_on_learning_how_to_learn_it_is_all_about/", "text": "5 years ago I began to teach myself web development in my spare time as I wanted to switch careers from a technical project manager to an Engineer. I previously studied comp sci and quickly realised how useless what I learned was in the real world. I was completely unprepared for the world of the web, I knew nothing about JavaScript, HTTP requests, how the web works and generally how to build anything modern. I did however know random algorithms and their complexity that I never once got to use ever again!\n\nToday I am leading a team of engineers as a Full Stack engineer. Learning the skills I needed took forming the right habits so I can concentrate as much \"useful\" learning as possible into my limited free time: after work, at lunch breaks, on the bus.. So I wanted to share here what helped me to form these habits and get the most of my learning. Hope it helps someone else too:\n\nLearning from articles, courses, documentation and examples is a great way to start getting the skills you need to get a job as an engineer but learning is hard. I used to often find myself super motivated and excited after attending a workshop or a meetup but then can\u2019t remember a single thing I learned only a week later. \n\nThe same thing happens to me if I read an article on a train on how to do a super exciting thing with CSS or something new and interesting about JavaScript but the excitement is gone once I realise I don\u2019t know where to start or how to apply what I have just learned. It can be demotivating. \n\n- *Motivation*\nIf you want to get the most out of your learning, there is one essential requirement, it\u2019s more important than any other technique or suggestion. Unless you ensure to fulfil this requirement no suggestions or millions of tips will be successful in helping you to get value out of any course/workshop/article. What is this requirement? A *deep desire to learn, then improve and ultimately master the basics* of web development. It must be a burning desire that fuels you, that keeps you going when you are having a lazy day or simply feel like giving up. But how do I get such a desire you might wonder? Constantly *remind yourself self why you learning to code* in the first place. Are you after a better paying job to increase your income and quality of life? Is web development a secret passion that was on hold and now you hope to take a full dive in and see how far you can take this? Think of different ways how having this new skill will improve your life, use this to fuel your determination and make the most of the course/workshop/article available to you.\n\n- *Don\u2019t skip the exercises*\nMany skills are learned by doing and in many course/articles there are exercises. Let\u2019s talk about deliberate practice: just practicing for the sake of practicing is simply not enough, in order to truly understand what you are trying to achieve and how you will go about it you must deliberately think about every step you are taking in the exercises. Even if you have done this exercise before, do it again! The second time make sure you understand every step and every decision. The end goal is not to complete the exercise but to gain wisdom.\n\n- *Question everything*\nAre you unfamiliar with a term you just read in some article? Look it up! Are you following a tutorial and find that you did not understand one of the steps you just did? Go back to it and re-read it again and again until you gain more clarity. It is only once you gain true understanding of all the steps you took to do something that you can rest assured you got lot\u2019s of value from reading the article/tutorial/course.\n\n- *Take notes*\nIf you see something that makes you go \u201coh that would be good to read more about\u201d, \u201cthat would be handy for the other things I am doing\u201d. Ask yourself as you read, where else could I apply this?\n\n- *Re-read*\nRe-read the articles again and again. Skimming the material will not give you any lasting benefit. The speed with which humans forget things is astonishing. To truly cement the ideas, techniques and advice in any article - re-read it. Remember that the only way to get good at something is to develop good habits and understanding in that area.\n\nRemember that learning is a process and everyone learns differently. You cannot simply become a developer by rushing through a course or reading a bunch of articles. Take every opportunity available to you to use the skills you have learned. This process will take time, it is a living thing that will grow and get better and adjust it as needed to make it work for you. But this is only possible if you actively participate in the process.\n\nStay curious, don\u2019t give up and be patient.", "score": 41, "comments": [{"body": "Thanks for such a wonderful advice.\nBut when i decide that i will learn code to become developer then suddenly thought arise that todays trend is of ai, bigdata ,cloud computing then why should i learn such language.\nI confuse so much that atlast i left it.", "id": "e4xekj4", "replies": [{"body": "Don't concentrate on the language but the task at hand, do you want to make websites? Do you want to make games? Do you want to make pixel perfect designs with amazing animations? Unfortunately just like anything else in life you have to pick and specialise.\n\nBut! Once you learn one thing, it is easier and easier to learn the next. I spend every day learning, simply for fun. It makes me a better developer in my job as I get exposed to different ideas, different paradigms and different ways of working.", "id": "e4zz4qa", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "May I ask how long you have been employed as an engineer?  Also, was it difficult to get interviews with company's because you were self-taught and didn't have prior experience?  Did you build a website as proof of your skills, or did you have another way to generate interest from employers.  Sorry if I am being nosy, I am just curious about the barriers to entry.  My motivation is I want to execute my own ideas, instead of relying on others. ", "id": "e4y4oot", "replies": [{"body": "`How long you have been employed as an engineer? `\n\nI am now in my 2.5 year as an Engineer and leading a team for a second role in a row.\n`was it difficult to get interviews with company's because you were self-taught and didn't have prior experience? `\nI did not find difficulty in getting the first stage interviews, but I did have lots of help in framing my CV to my strength and not to how many years of professional experience I had.\nI had tailored my CV to show off my side projects and my ambitions as well as highlighting any relevant previous experience.  The years spent doing something else count too!\nBeing self taught shows you are a hard worker, a keen learner, good at self motivating, these are valuable skills in any job. Today as I interview other engineers I look for those skills as I know how hard they will throw themselves into a new job and how much they wanted this in the first place to put themselves through all this.\n`Did you build a website as proof of your skills, or did you have another way to generate interest from employers`\nI built a simple website to show off my projects, it is here: http://lilianakastilio.co.uk/ The whole site itself was a stretch of my skills at the time and to this day serves it's purpose well. \n\nI also added EVERYTHING I ever did to Github and always shared this in my CV, just as a tip all future employees will either google you or have software that can pull in that data for them of all your social media accounts. \n\nDon't worry about being nosy, if it helps even one person me sharing the answers then t is worth it :)\n", "id": "e5008rq", "replies": []}]}], "title": "My tips on learning how to \"learn\", it is all about getting the right habits!"}
