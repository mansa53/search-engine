With this I mean just explaining a concept in depth and giving some examples and afterwards give some questions and exercises or even small projects. \n\nI also want to do this because I feel like a lot of videos on youtube about learning programming just consist of making a small program that uses a lot of the fundamentals but they don't really explain in detail what they are doing.\n\nWould people still be interested in this?\n\nP.S. with university-like approach I don't mean that the videos would be like lectures, I want to make them fun and entertaining to watch.", "score": 232, "comments": [{"body": "Well, I'm not your audience, but I am generally much in favour of texbooks or MOOCs where you get one author's point of view through the whole course.

The majority of programming videos are exactly what you want to make. I actually have a hard time finding videos that go in depth in a language while actually letting you MAKE something.\n\nBut if I just want to learn the basics of a language I can type \"learn X language\" into youtube and find thousands of videos all going over the same introductory information for each language. They all go like this:\nVideo one: \"What is X language\"\nVideo two: variables\nVideo three: math operations.\n\nAnd it just goes on like this and you can find thousands of them for any language. So you should make the videos if you want to do it but its not like your the only one who had the idea.
