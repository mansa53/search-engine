Just like in English a grammar specifies how to write a sentence for example in present simple.\n\nAs for why it's needed again using the English analogy no one will understand what you mean unless you adhere to the grammar rules :) and that's pretty much it. You can't have a language without grammar.\n\nGrammar consists of production rules which tells you how to construct a statement (sentence in English).\n\nBNF (Backus Naur Form) is just a notation used to specify the grammar of a language.\n\nIf you just want to know more about it read the wikipedia articles about context free grammar and BNF.\n\nOtherwise, if you really want to learn about compilers design and implementation then grab a book and start reading. I recommend modern compiler implementation the first chapters will answer your questions in more depth.", "id": "e53yr5n", "replies": []}], "title": "BNF grammar notation"}
