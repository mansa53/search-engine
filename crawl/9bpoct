(PS I was the turtle talking to you -- hahahahah)\n\nI do not 100% believe that you went from 0 programming to this site in a year, but everyone learns at a different pace so I'm not denying it is possible.\n\nSo React, Redux, Websockets it appears? Man, those letschat socket frames were coming fast and furious while I was in the main chat. Any cool implementation details you want to divulge?", "id": "e551slr", "replies": [{"body": "thank you!\n\n\u200b\n\nYou are correct that I didn't come from a zero programming background. I hope the title wasn't too misleading. I took a course in high school and a course in college as well. I was a design major then dropped out and taught myself to code in 14 months while doing contract dev work (which btw is the best tool when learning to code). I hope that is a bit more specific.\n\n\u200b\n\nAnd yes the stack is React/Redux and D3 on the client and Node, Express, MongoDB, WebSockets (uws module) on the back. There are a couple of unique things that come to mind:\n\n1. Unlike a traditional real-time server in a multiplayer video game, I don't need the state to be as perfectly in sync as possible (there are no hitboxes that have to be exactly lined up for every user to be fair). So instead of 45-60 updates per second, I just send 10,  and then use some smoothing magic on the client so the user will never know. You can get 2 seconds behind from packet loss and the user can't even tell. This effectively eliminates lag.\n2. Many users might not care about this feature, but I built in a client protection mechanism for displaying messages. Basically, no one can see your chat messages unless they are in your view and vice versa. So you know that you are only chatting with the people in your view. This solves the situation where some user on a 4K monitor could zoom out in a circle and lurk on 100 chats going on. I render every user's view uniquely to them based on every user's view around them for every update.\n3. On the ws server I use a quadtree when pulling all of the users in a client's custom view. This is exponentially more efficient than looping through every user and checking if they are within a client's view (whichI originally did). In my testing I can currently scale to 1K concurrent users in a single circle on a single core. Without quadree this would be more like 50-100. If you are interested here is some info on [how a quadtree works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree).\n\nIf you are interested in keeping up with development head over to r/ChatCircles.
