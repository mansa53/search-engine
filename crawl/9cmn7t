{"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9cmn7t/my_first_internship/", "text": "So I have about a year since starting learning web dev.\n\n\u200b\n\nI currently attend an 8 month program web development technical program at school where they teach me a a whole variety of languages, I finish in October. I make honours grades.\n\n\u200b\n\nI decided to start applying for jobs and internships early since I do nothing during the day and go to school at night.\n\n\u200b\n\nOn my second ever interview for a web dev position, I got past the HR portion and they sent me a technical test, full of OOP definitions and javascript type problems to solve. ( no technical interview). I passed the test and recently got word that I got the internship at a \"startup\" company. (I applied on a site where they post only startups).\n\n\u200b\n\nThe company wants me to code in REACT. Now I have never learned react before. But they say this is not a problem and will train me. My first two days on the job, they direct me to various materials, websites to study from including react, bootstrap react and typescript. (no actual training).\n\n\u200b\n\nI start doing actual work and projects for the company on Tuesday and I am very nervous on how I will perform, and how I will contribute. I'm feeling some imposter's syndrome. React seems like a complicated language, and though I think understand the very basics of operations and syntax through my understanding of javascript and frameworks, I don't think I understand the underlying point to all the fancy react code, other than it is reusable. It just seems kind of hard at first.\n\n\u200b\n\nI'm working their front end, on their web site which I have been assigned to work on.\n\n\u200b\n\nWhat kind of things do you predict I will be tasked to do, how will I use react to accomplish their needs? I work with around 5 other web dev interns at any given time, but there are more part timers.\n\n\u200b\n\nAlso, it is a little disappointing that I am working full time without getting paid, but am extremely thankful that I can make my \"break\" in this industry and get some experience I can put on my resume.\n\n\u200b\n\nHow long should I stay with this company before looking elsewhere for paying jobs? They go public this month, where the HR lady tells me they may start paying interns, but I'm not holding my breathe.\n\n\u200b\n\nThanks", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "I think it's pretty rare to have \"training\" for a framework at a job. You might have some on-boarding where they show you around their code-base and introduce you to their standards, but learning the skills is up to you. Obviously you can ask your co-workers with more experience how they would handle a situation if you're stuck, but you should try to figure it out on your own first. \n\nYou don't really need to understand _why_ you're using React to be able to develop in React, but there are thousands of articles explaining why React is good or bad. \n\nCan't predict what you'll be tasked to do, you can use React to handle pretty much any front-end web development task. Really depends on what your product is.\n\nMy suggestion is to not work without pay unless you're building something for yourself, your friends/family, or for some cause you believe in. So if I were you, I'd start looking for a paying internship _now_ while you wait to find out whether there's any truth to the HR lady's words.\n\nBest of luck.", "id": "e5bqso5", "replies": []}], "title": "My first internship"}
