I am completely self taught. I know that JavaScript is used for websites but what programming language are used for the folowing:\n1. Desktop apps\n2.

If you want to have native look and feel you typically go with the platform's options, e.g., .net or windows forms on windows or cocoa and swift/obj-c on mac or I'm not sure on linux.  If you don't care about look and feel you can use cross platform options like java or python or really anything else you can find a windowing toolkit for.\n\n> Android apps\n\nJava, but I think there are ways to use C and/or C++ for really low level things, but I'm not sure.\n\n> just wondering why sometimes many different languages are used at once\n\nA lot of times it has to do with cross compatibility.  Maybe the platform you're on needs a specific language to use the windowing api to get that native look and feel, but you write the core of your app in something else that can be used on other platforms.  There are lots of other reasons to use multiple languages, though, it just depends on the project.
