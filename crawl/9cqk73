Don't flip between lowerCamelCase and UpperCamelCase for your functions.\n\n* You *can* simplify this:\n\n        if (increasing && intToStringSize(endingValue) == word.length()) {\n                increasing = false;\n        }\n\n    to this:\n            \n         increasing = !(increasing && intToStringSize(endingValue) == word.length());\n\n    though this is just me being nitpicky.\n\nOtherwise it's fine.", "id": "e5cuj0q", "replies": [{"body": "What what way would that be considered simpler?

This reduces the risks for walking off arrays and is more idiomatic.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAvoid needless casts.  If a function argument is going to be used as a string index then use std::string::size_type as its type.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nInside of CharsBetweenTwoValues consider using std::string::substr instead off appending characters one at a time.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n    set loop variable\n    while(condition)\n    {\n        code\n        ....        \n        update loop variable\n    }\n\nIs a pattern that generally should be rewritten as a for loop.", "id": "e5cr5ad", "replies": []}, {"body": "I like that you declared a variable  `const int beginingValue = 0`. A lot of people would simply pass a magic number to  `CharsBetweenTwoValues` without expressing intent.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe only thing I would change is the signature of your functions.\n\nFrom:  `std::string CharsBetweenTwoValues(std::string baseString, signed int from, signed int to) ;`\n\nTo: `std::string CharsBetweenTwoValues(const std::string& baseString, signed int from, signed int to) {`\n\nThat's because in `main` you first create a string object and then pass it to `stringPattern`. If you pass by value the compiler will have to perform a deep copy of `thing`. I would only recommend your function signature if you want to manipulate the passed string.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis isn't criticism towards your program.
