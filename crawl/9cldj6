I run a YouTube channel (Web Dev Simplified), and am trying to brainstorm series ideas that I can produce alongside my normal weekly uploads. One idea I had was to produce a series where I complete CSS coding challenges from either coding websites or user submissions in order to help others understand how to complete these problems and most importantly to help others see someone with a large amount of web development experience tackle a problem and see why I do what I do.\n\nI plan on explaining my thought process as well as my reasoning behind my chooses to make the series educational since that is the main point of my channel.\n\nThe main concern I have is I do not know if there is much demand for such content, and that is where you lovely Redditors come in. Please let me know if this is something you would be interested in personally and if so why.\n\nThank you so much for taking your time to read this.\n\n\nEDIT: I have gotten quite a bit of good feedback for this idea, and plan to go forward with it. If anyone has any ideas for the first challenge feel free to let me know below. Thanks again everybody.", "score": 28, "comments": [{"body": "I think that's a great idea that could be helpful to a lot of people.
