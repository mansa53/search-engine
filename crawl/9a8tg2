I've been trying to make a code, that will calculate how much has the camera moved between two pictures. It's not about an actual scale, like meters or feet, I just need to know the difference in pixels between picture A and picture B.\n\nNow about pictures themselves: The camera is moving in a horizontal plane, \"scanning\" what's beneath it. I don't have the altitude of the plane, niether diameters of objects in the photos, nor velocity of the camera (if I had, I wouldn't ask this question). There is no specific direction of the camera, so it can go forward, backward or sideways.\n\nAnd here is, where it gets even more tricky - most of the pictures contain concrete or sand. They do have some recognisible patterns, but I understand, that sometimes the algorithm may have a bad time.\n\nI have to admit - I know almost nothing about picture processing, so I am trying to catch a start-point.\n\nI would really appreciate some code examples, but links or even pure searchbar topics are really welcome. Also, I will be more than happy to answer any questions about this project, as it means you read it ;)\n\nThank you for any help.", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "You want a feature detection algorithm.
