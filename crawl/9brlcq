{"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9brlcq/im_taking_an_intro_to_java_class_questions_about/", "text": "So I'm taking an Intro to Java class at my local community college. I took an Intro to C++ class back in 2011, and even though I got an A in the class, my professor was awful (Persian guy who could barely speak English, would make lots of mistakes, didn't let us use any PCs in class at all ever despite it being a \"hands on\" polytechnic university, had to physically print out our source code, etc.) and I never really got further into it past that one class. I'm mostly taking this class to get into programming as a hobby. My instructor for this Java class seems really nice and helpful so far though. We are using the BlueJ IDE to write our apps, and this class only covers making console based apps. I just have a few questions regarding Java for you guys:\n\n1. Application security. Although it is proclaimed that Java runs on billions on devices (particularly Android, but it's a special fork...) -- the standard Java runtime environment is not bundled with new PCs anymore for security reasons. It's completely unsupported in Google Chrome. Should I be programming with something that is notorious for being inherently insecure? It's almost becoming an Adobe Flash type of situation at this point with constant security updates and vulnerabilities.\n2. How difficult is it to go from command line programming to creating graphically based desktop or mobile apps? I'm talking simple forms based apps with buttons and input text boxes.\n3. I've heard that C# is very similar to Java. Is it pretty straightforward to switch to C# from Java?\n4. Since flip phones are basically dead and Android exists, does anyone even use the official Java Mobile Edition anymore?\n5. For those of you who do a lot of Java programming, what kinds of apps do you develop?\n6. IDEs -- What IDE do you use? Eclipse, NetBeans, IntelliJ, BlueJ, something else?", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "ad 1.: The security problems you are talking about mainly affected *Java Applets* which are a dead technology anyway. The support for Java Applets has been dropped completely with Java 9. Your statement about browsers not supporting Java is not entirely correct. The browsers stopped supporting the NPAPI plugin quite some time ago. This does not only apply to Chrome; it applies to most major browsers.\n\nad 2.: GUI and mobile apps use different frameworks. Writing a GUI app is just a different way of thinking. Command line apps usually are *guided* in a way that the sequence of inputs and outputs is completely predetermined. GUI and mobile apps use an *Event driven* model. If a program is written following the [SOLID principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) and as far as applicable the [MVC Design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller), switching the presentation layer (i.e. console vs GUI) is fairly simple.\n\nad 3.: Yes, C# on basic level is fairly similar to Java. Quite often the statement \"Learn Java (C#) and get the other free\" is made. This applies only at basic level. Higher level concepts are quite different between the languages. Yet, transitioning from one to the other is fairly easy. Were it not for different capitalization (in Java, methods are generally camelCase while in C# they are PascalCase) elementary programs couldn't be distinguished whether they are C# or Java.\n\nad 4.: The Java Mobile Edition is more or less dead. Still, there are plenty non smartphones on the market that use it - but these phones are commonly in poorer/less developed countries.\n\nad 5.: Just about anything\n\nad 6.: Personally, I prefer Eclipse because that is what I have most experience with. I also use IntelliJ. Never liked Netbeans. BlueJ is not an IDE. It is plain crap. Not even useful as learning IDE.", "id": "e557wfg", "replies": []}, {"body": "1. Java never came bundled on PCs, you've always had to install it manually. Java isn't really used for developing web plugins anymore though, which I think is the main reason that browsers stopped supporting it. It's still extensively used in other applications though.\n2. See desrtfx's answer.\n3. Yes, the languages are very similar. Some details very but much of what you learn with transfer to C# with minimal changes.\n4. I have no idea.\n5. At work I've written servers and pipelines in Java.\n6. IntelliJ is by far the most popular IDE for Java these days, though I haven't used it much. I never cared much for Eclipse but it still has it's users.", "id": "e55aw99", "replies": []}, {"body": ">It's completely unsupported in Google Chrome\n\nThe part of Java you're talking about here is Java **Applets**, and they were garbage to begin with. It's not necessarily Java itself that was insecure here, it was the plugin API that it interacted with (same as Flash, NPAPI).\n\n>Should I be programming with something that is notorious for being inherently insecure\n\nIt's not notorious nor is it inherently insecure. For example, a Java runtime is installed by default on macOS. Usually the vulnerabilities in Java on Windows are due to unpatched JREs.\n\n>How difficult is it to go from command line programming to creating graphically based desktop or mobile apps?\n\nDifficulty is relative and subjective, so \"how\" is a meaningless and answerless question. Suffice to say it's different and since there's more going on, it's more complex. How much more, well...dive in and see for yourself.\n\n>I've heard that C# is very similar to Java\n\nDepends on how advanced you are. The basics are almost the same. The higher-level features diverge significantly, and have only started to converge again with Java 9. I find that most of the people that say \"Java and C# are basically the same language!\" are the people that haven't worked professionally with both of them, or haven't done anything beyond writing console applications with them.\n\n>does anyone even use the official Java Mobile Edition anymore\n\nNo. Feel free to forget that it exists entirely.\n\n>For those of you who do a lot of Java programming\n\nI'll leave this for others to answer.\n\n>IDEs \n\nNot BlueJ or Dr. Java, that's for sure. They can be useful tools for learning purposes, but the most popular IDEs for Java are the ones you've mentioned: IntelliJ (which is also Android Studio), Eclipse, and NetBeans.", "id": "e55kbip", "replies": []}, {"body": "Thanks for your responses!
