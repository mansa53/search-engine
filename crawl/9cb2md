I just finished uploading a [Snake Game Tutorial in Python 3 for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP7KMlbvtOo&list=PLlEgNdBJEO-n8k9SR49AshB9j7b5Iw7hZ)to my YouTube channel. It uses the turtle module for graphics. You can [download the finished code here](https://gist.github.com/wynand1004/ec105fd2f457b10d971c09586ec44900) if you want to check it out. I hope somebody finds it helpful.", "score": 354, "comments": [{"body": "Thank you!  These types of tutorials are really helpful for people like myself who lack trigger time programming, and so feel like they lack creativity.  I think lack of creativity is simply due to lack of time doing your desired activity.  The more you see others doing it, the more you can emulate it, and think of how it was done, and if any improvements could be made, the more creative one is going to get.  At least thats how it works for me.", "id": "e59rx29", "replies": [{"body": "More importantly, how you can adapt it over to a different language and platform.", "id": "e59vrc1", "replies": [{"body": "Hopefully!
