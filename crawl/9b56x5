My school is saying 53 and I can't tell if it's actually 80. I need to know if it's 80 so I can drop. http://lewisu.smartcatalogiq.com/Undergrad-2018-2019/undergraduate-catalog/College-of-Arts-and-Sciences/Computer-Science/Computer-Science-Bachelor-of-Science\n\nI have about 62 credits from a CC but really no CS requirements since I changed my major to CS. It says I need 53, but when I pick a concentration it kind of confuses me.\n\nCan someone here who has graduated in CS (a lot of you) give insight? How many actually Computer Science credits did your college need out of you? Also did you choose a concentration?", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "67 excluding the calculus courses. 75 if you include them.", "id": "e50hpq3", "replies": []}], "title": "Please answer this... how many credits did you need in college for your CS degree?"}
