Also, I make no comments money wise, just how it looks as a coding bootcamp.\n\nIt seems great for becoming a web dev. You spend half the time on the front end. Then another large chunk on the back end with DB focus. All sounds really good and should make you a competent web dev.\n\nIt say's you'll \"Take a deep dive into core Java and\nObject-Oriented Programming\". Sounds great, but you only get 2 weeks, when you spent 3 weeks on JSON and AJAX? Then you spend 2 weeks on \"a deep dive into\nthe **basics** of coding and algorithms\". So, you learn some basic algorithms that you aren't going to use in the class because it's too late. This is because as you're learning these fundamentals you're supposed to have already started your final project.\n\nAfter this program, I would not call you a software engineer. I would call you a Web Developer. This because that is what they're teaching you how to do, and gloss over anything more substantial than that. 2 Weeks for a whole different language and programming style, isn't enough to say you're a Java developer.\n\nPersonally, I can't stand doing web development. I'm bad at it, and it is just not fun to me. This is why I'm a hard core server side back end developer. I love that crap. They just don't make bootcamps for that. So, if you want to be a web dev and like that line of work.

It required a slightly more than basic beginning level to join, and if you ever failed a test or project. You were dropped from the class. Because if you ever fall behind, there's no catching up. They had I think 12 hour day's, 6 days a week, of instruction and programming\n\nSome people definitely fail out each class, but for everyone that passes, they have a solid grasp full stack web development.", "id": "e4zb4zh", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Thanks for the good response.

That really helped me get a well rounded knowledge, and showed me what I really enjoyed doing. Once I got my job as a Java Back End developer.
