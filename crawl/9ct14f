Just find the largest power of two that is smaller than your number, subtract it, note it down and repeat, like this:\n\nWith number 1315\n\nSmallest power of two is 1024, subtracting we get 291\n\n`1`\n\nNow we just move down one power after another, the next is 512, which does not fit so we add a 0\n\n`10`\n\n256 fits so we add a 1 and subtract, 35\n\n`101`\n\n128 and 64 do not fit so we add two 0's\n\n`10100`\n\n32 fits, leaving us with 3\n\n`101001`\n\n16, 8, 4 do not fit, but 2 and then 1 does\n\n`10100100011`\n\nWe have arrived at 2^0, so the series is complete.

Most of us (me included) converted from binary to base 10, then base 10 to hexadecimal. The work required took multiple pages of tedious arithmetic.\n\nThe key point to remember is that converting from binary to hexadecimal can be done directly, by simply converting sets of 4 bits into a single hexadecimal digit. For instance, the binary number 10100110 is hexadecimal 0xA6, because 10100110 can be grouped as 1010 + 0110, and 1010 is A (in hexadecimal), and 0110 is 6 (in hexadecimal).\n\nFor converting between these bases to/from base 10, that is kinda tedious.
