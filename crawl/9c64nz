Are there languages that would be better for the back end? I normally can figure stuff out by googling but i'm way out of my depth here.  For instance, I know i'm going to need to create a script that will scrape other websites for pricing information but I don't even know the proper terminology to use when googling.  Its very much a \"I don't know what I don't know\" type of thing.  If you were going to attempt a project like this what language would you use for that? Also i'm probably going to have to create some large databases.  Only database stuff I know about is mySQL but thats probably super dated.
