I am comfortable on the back-end side, but am stuck on how to create the front end in a way that will end with a good-looking product. I have knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS, but not to the point of where its going to look good. Basically I am wondering if there is any tool like Squarespace or Wix that I can use to design my site, but can export the design to HTML code so I can use it with flask. I have tried using Pingendo, but I found that it had limited style control through the GUI and was generally difficult to use. \n\nAny tips or suggestions welcome.", "score": 1, "comments": [], "title": "GUI tools for front-end"}
