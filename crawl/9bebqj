I work a government job and there is a lot of manual work in terms of data entry, copy pasting from excel sheets into GUI database applications. We are not able to install python and all we have available is Powershell and whatever else windows comes with out of the box. The SAP application we do use has the scripting functionality disabled so they give clerks only limited functionality. \n\nIs there anyway to script Powershell to control x,y mouse coordinates or something? I am thinking of ways to cut down  6 hour+ tasks into almost automatic few minute tasks. There is lots of clicking buttons on these GUI applications and scrolling through menu options.\n\nIf anyone has succeeded in automating office work please comment or pm me!
