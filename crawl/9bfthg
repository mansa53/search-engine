I was thinking of creating a variable equal to the value of the text input and then on the search button\u2019s click it runs a function to check which stock was searched.. if we have the stock how would I redirect to its page? Would this work:  href=\u201c\u201d and then do something like document.getElementById(\u201c\u201d).value = ./stockpage.html  ?? I guess I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s something where I can set an href value like document.getElementByHref but then how would I specify which href I\u2019m referring to?? Ughhhh beginner problems! :)", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "You can use the [window.location](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/location) JavaScript object to redirect the user to another page.\n\nAs for mobile designs. I know this isn't helpful in this case, but for future websites it is normally good to design for mobile devices first, then make it responsive for larger devices. For your current website though I would recommend having a hamburger drop down menu for your navbar on mobile devices. On smaller screens I would also make the line height a little smaller on the paragraphs on mobile so a little more shows on screen. \n\nFor your paragraphs, in my opinion (as someone with an awful attention span), your paragraphs are fine. They are already a suitable length and seperated nicely. I don't think they need any work there.\n\nLooking at the source there is still a lot of `<br>` tags. This should be done in css using margin top instead.\n\nAside from that, I think the website is looking good.
