Personally I recall microsoft's PIX has the highlighting in particular that you are asking about.  Though in all honesty, looking at the function graphs (either top-down or bottom-up) to find hot *functions* is a lot more productive than looking for hot lines of code.  Since your functions should be small and single-purpose, it should be fairly obvious where your hot-spot is within a given function.", "id": "e5ccg3a", "replies": []}], "title": "Code heat map"}
