I have done quite a few projects, mostly in the web development and mobile development areas.\n\nMy preferred languages include:\n\nJavascript <3 (Intermediate)\n\nJava (Basic OOP)\n\nC++ (Learning at university)\n\nSo my question is what should I do to land an internship at top companies like dropbox, toyota, tesla, google, etc...\n\nGive me advice on what projects I should work on, and concepts I need to familiarize myself with.\n\n\u200b\n\nThank You for your time.", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "You should have a strong understanding of data structures and algorithms at the minimum. Having a decent understanding of things like systems, concurrency, and parallelism would also help for certain companies (e.g. dropbox). \n\nBasically, most intern/new grad tech interviews are skewed towards assessing how well you understand common computer science concepts/that you're a strong generalist.\n\nThat's how Google interviews, for example -- they make sure you'd be a good fit for many different kinds of roles during the first wave of interviews, then match you with a specific team (aka \"host-matching\") second.\n\nYour mastery of a specific programming language is almost an afterthought, tbh -- the assumption is that you already know one language well and are capable of picking up new languages on-the-fly once the internship starts.\n\nThings may be a little different if you're going after something specific like frontend or mobile -- can't help you much there.\n\nYou should try asking /r/cscareerquestions for more details. You should also consider purchasing or borrowing a copy of \"Cracking the Coding Interview\".\n\nAlso finally, I'm not sure if I would necessarily classify Toyota as being the same sort of company as the other three you list -- they don't seem to go actively recruiting computer science people, AFAIK. Tesla's more borderline/recruits both engineering and CS grads.\n\n", "id": "e4ve5pn", "replies": [{"body": "Thank you, will post in r/cscareerquestions \n\nI listed toyota cuz I remember seeing some internship listings online.", "id": "e4vebem", "replies": []}]}], "title": "How to land an Internship in a top company?"}
