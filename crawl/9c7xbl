I have absolute 0 experience with coding, but I know that there's something that I want to try to make.\n\nI want to make a chat website that's a mixture of Omegle and 7 cups. Basically each person would have a user profile and a rating, and you can connect and chat with a random person based on things such as age/interest/user rating. Things like that. There would also be user profiles/friends list if you want to keep in contact with the person, and the website could be used for things such as emotional support.\n\nI know something like that is probably way complex for a beginner, but I have no clue how I would even begin to go about learning how to make something like this, could someone point me in the right direction and show me the kinds of things I would need to learn to create this specifically?", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "You are going to want to learn Full Stack web development.

Then you'd need to learn JavaScript that will be used to make your website interactive. Now you'd need a database and server. The server can be programmed in any language, but I'd recommend nodejs and Python because they are fast and I personally enjoy them. For the database you can use either a nosql or Sql database. Sql database arrange your info into tables like a excel sheet while nosql databases don't arrange the data in tables.
