One application in JS and one application in Python.\n\nHowever, I don't really know any software, that I can use to create JavaScript and Python applications..... \n\nDo you guys know of any?", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "If you\u2019re a very beginner I recommend learning from a website like codeacademy.com.", "id": "e54aaro", "replies": []}, {"body": "I have no idea what you're asking.

You can then type a Python program in Notepad, and then run it from the command-line. For example, save a program called \"[hello.py](https://hello.py)\", then open a command prompt window and type \"python hello,py\" to run it.\n\nAlternatively, you can get a programming text editor like Notepad++, Atom, Visual Studio Code, etc. and those have functions to run your code right from within the editor.\n\nAs for JavaScript, one option is to put your JavaScript inside of a web page (like include it from an HTML file) and then open the web page in your web browser. Every modern web browser has a JavaScript debugger built in, you can use that to step through your code and watch it run.\n\nAlternatively, you can install Node.js and run JavaScript programs from the command line just like Python.\n\nFinally, there are tools to package both Python and JavaScript programs so that people can just download them, install them, and run them, just like any other software you'd get from the Internet. So your friends wouldn't have to install Python first, you could embed it all in one package. But that's a ways off - focus on building something first.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "e549nzi", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "I believe you're looking for an integrated development environment (IDE).
