I think people often ignore this book because it uses Racket (and functional programming) but it's a truly great book for everyone interested in computer programming (from newcomers to experienced programmers).\n\nThe book is free, didactic and doesn't assume any previous experience in programming, have tons of exercises and teaches computer science that will probably be used through your whole career. The book also uses the DrRacket IDE which is an awesome teaching platform, being easy to use, install and needing no hard setup.\n\nHtDP was created as an alternative to SICP as an introductory computer science book using functional programming and the whole motivation of it is described in this [paper](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/racket/pubs/jfp2004-fffk.pdf) by the book' authors.\n\nI also think SICP is a great book and should be read, but HtDP is way better for beginners.", "score": 9, "comments": [{"body": "I recently looked into How To Code: Simple Data on EdX and they teach Racket too.", "id": "e5208kb", "replies": [{"body": "Yep, that course is built around the design recipe taught in HtDP", "id": "e5231rn", "replies": [{"body": "Wow \ud83d\ude2e ", "id": "e52qzvi", "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "this one also goes along kinda on the same lines, but it's in python http://composingprograms.com/ It's a good alternative for people who are not into functional programming or lisps", "id": "e52a8lr", "replies": []}], "title": "How to Design Programs is a great book and shouldn't be overlooked as a first programming book"}
