Honestly though, I'm not a logical guy but more of artistic visual person which was why I'm having alot of trouble learning programming (though it's fun after I figure it out). For some reason though, after working on programming, I'm able to solve other problems better for some reason. You know one of those people who listen to other people's explanation about specific topic and can't even understand what the hell they were saying and need them to repeat few more times just to get the basis of topic? Yeah, I'm one of those guys. I even have trouble reading and understanding something as in I need to go over multiple times. However, after I spend hours programming, I'm able to concentrate better and able to problem-solve more easily. Maybe it's because I'm usually in my la-la land getting these crazy fantasy ideas while listening to music being artistic that it's getting in the way of thinking logically? So although creating part is what hooked me up in the first place, I'm generally doing this to improve myself in a way I guess. \n\nDo you think this is a good reason to do programming? What was your reason for starting out? \n", "score": 4, "comments": [{"body": "This was part of my attraction to programming as well. A lot of us enjoy the creative and expressive aspects, as well as the improving of problem solving skills. I find programming to be relaxing and meditative as well, one of the only things where I can sit and really get fixated on solving a problem and working. Like a lot of skills, programming can definitely have benefits in other areas of your life.

I started programming in high school because it sounded interesting. I really liked the puzzle-solving aspect, but didn't end up making a career out of it until much later. I still enjoy that aspect of the job. I like that I have to learn programming *and* whatever industry I'm working in (currently residential mortgage-backed securities, something I never even knew existed). I like that I get paid well.

In terms of people working like this, they often end up stuck and unable to move up or at best very unhappy with their lives.\n", "id": "e56b7kc", "replies": [{"body": "I mean as I said I'm artistic guy so my passion is more of art and music but when it comes to programming, I guess it started out as more of interest.
