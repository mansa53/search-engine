It sounded like a relatively easy job, and that there would be a pattern I could recognize and solve the problem. However, after going into their WP dashboard and into the Redirection Plugin, it's showing 40k 404 errors! This is a news site with quite a lot of posts. I've noticed in some cases the url would be [test.com/723409720934/article-name-here.html](https://test.com/723409720934/article-name-here.html) and simply removing the long number and html off the back would solve it. But, this isn't even working every time. Maybe 1 in 3 times this will solve that specific url type's issue.\n\n\u200b\n\nAnother thing I've noticed, is it's throwing 404 errors for articles which don't even exist on the site (according to the site's search, google search and searching through the posts on the WP dashboard.) I'm really confused by the whole thing and honestly have no idea how to proceed. Can anyone lend some help?\n\n\u200b\n\nHere's an example pic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/gUmnPsZ.png](https://i.imgur.com/gUmnPsZ.png)", "score": 3, "comments": [{"body": "Screenshot is blurry for me. Can't read it. \n\nMost likely previous URLs existed one way or another and you don't have proper redirects. \n\nKeep in mind that is a log of errors not necessary unique errors. So 40k times hitting the same error URL could make it look like you have 40k errors. \n\nStart tackling the ones you can in bulk like the example you posted via regex redirect where you can then narrow down from there.
