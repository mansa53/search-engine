I'll get unique visitors (at times multiple but mostly one) from a `t.co` domain on about 20 repos. I've only ever linked to my GitHub via twitter twice, and for those it makes sense, but on these when I click to see the t.co path then click the Path link (presumably to see where it was tweeted?) then it just reloads my GitHub page.\n\nIt's odd because it's started cloning any new repo I make soon after it's creation, and the reference site for the visitor is always Twitter.

We expect all participants on this subreddit to stay civil and professional at all times, even if you happen to disagree with one another.\n\n---\n\nNow, taking off my mod hat and speaking to OP...\n\nYes, this is a bit unusual, but people write bots that do all sorts of weird stuff with Github. Some of these bots are relatively harmless (e.g. let's do some data analysis for a student project), some are more malicious (e.g. let's scrape every single new repo and commit and see if we can steal a password or an API key).\n\nI think it's generally ok to just chalk this sort of stuff up as being a part of the random noise of the internet -- you should assume pretty much anything you post publicly, whether it's on Github or another site, is going to be scraped in one form or another.\n\nIt's hard for me to say more about your specific scenario w/o more information though -- if you're up for posting a link to one of your repos, somebody here could take a look.", "id": "e4ydgzg", "replies": []}, {"body": "> It's odd because it's started cloning any new repo I make soon after it's creation, ...

Maybe that person/bot puts your code into a database and stores it forever. Maybe it gets immediately deleted. No way to know for sure. \n\nOne thing you could try: If it ever gets posted publicly, probably it will eventually be indexed by Google, so one way to see if it's been reposted is to occasionally search the Internet for distinctive parts of your code and see if anything turns up. Probably this won't work if it's been reposted in an archive like a ZIP file though.
