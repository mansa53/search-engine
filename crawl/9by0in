I have a little experience with node and express but not the best. I know how make web apps with JSP and MySQL so I am not new in database design and web development.

I would choose between Angular and React, there's no need to learn both, so I would focus on React. React + Firebase are a great combo, they play really well together when you use something like Redux. If your plan is to become a frontend developer MongoDB is the last thing you want to invest your time on.
