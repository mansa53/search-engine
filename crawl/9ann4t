Thought I'd share this as a useful resource and also request feedback if anyone has content on how to further get people to take real actions to start programming. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith that said, here's [The Last Guide I\u2019ll Write for People Who Keep Saying They Want to Start](https://bttrdvlpr.com/the-last-guide/).  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThrough a large investment of time, I've painfully realized that there's a point where people can only help themselves. I hope that if this article isn't able to get someone to take action, readers who have done more talking than doing will at least be honest to both themselves and others of why they haven't started yet, instead of blaming people with some kind of excuse.

So, it takes a good person to continue to help others.   \n\n\nI especially enjoyed the reassurance of \"I don't think I can do it\" isn't' true.  Unfortunately, I have a lot of memories of negative comments I've received throughout my life, they follow me around like a ghost whispering insecurities to me. Shortly after I finished graduate classes in Psychology I had mentioned to a friend of mine that I should have went into computer science or similar degree but had been too afraid of the \"math\" involved. He responded by telling me that I would never last in Computer Science because it was \"2500x harder than Psychology.\"  I also vividly remember a high school math teach calling me an idiot in front of the class because I couldn't do simple math in my head.   \n\n\nHowever, I also remember the first day of college statistics class and the professor said, \"I know a lot of you are scared of this class but rest assured, I'll make sure you understand the concepts\" and he did and I LOVED it. This tells me that it is possible to learn and love concepts that are difficult.

People ending up with all sorts of limiting beliefs that are unfounded, sometimes rooted so deep that it becomes a part of their identity (e.g. \"I suck at math\" or \"I'm just not an artistic type\").\n\nThen it can compound itself when the person repeatedly runs into a situation where they are forced to learn X thing they \"suck at\" and are learning it from someone who is poor at teaching it; it just becomes session after session of \"point proven, see I'm terrible at it and can never learn it well,\" further ingraining it as part of the person's identity and making it all the more impossible for them to confront it realistically.\n\nHistory was the subject where this happened for me with a surprise turnaround. Absolutely hated it in most of school. So boring, dry, just endless lists of dates and facts.\n\nThen I had this one history teacher in college, I took something like 3 classes with him in total as electives. He framed history as a lively discussion and presentation, making it feel like real events that happened to real people, not just figures written down in a list. He gave us books and assignments that were rooted in perspectives and arguments crafted by historians, not just pages upon pages of dictations of what occurred. Totally changed my perspective on my supposed dislike of history.", "id": "e4xpdby", "replies": []}, {"body": "I'm so glad that there was someone there for you to prove those two very negative people wrong. Wanna know something slightly embarrassing? It took me 7 years to get my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Part of it was because I had a hard time being focused, another was because I was so horrible at math. \n\nI did so badly on an interview that involved math one time that someone actually asked me, 'are you sure you're a computer science major?' It was my very first interview that involved a live coding session with eight people watching every keystroke. I froze, and to this day it's the most horrible experience interviewing I've ever had. \n\nI went back to school after a break and took my time taking the Senior level courses and received As in pretty much all of the courses. The key was going slow - I didn't go full time. This rings true what you just said, taking the time to understand concepts is key, and it is possible to learn and love concepts that are difficult. The important portion is the effectiveness of the manner in which the content is conveyed. Everyone goes at their own pace, and again, I'm glad there was someone who was more accomplished than your friend and High School teacher who showed you what was possible! \n\nIf you'd like to talk directly to myself and other people who are learning just like you, feel free to join the Discord channel [here](https://discord.gg/6HCADm7).
