{"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9a9b57/advice_needed/", "text": ">Hello, I have been slowly getting more confident in my programming skills, I would like to potentially start helping people on GitHub or maybe stack overflow so that I can explain things to others while helping me learn the content too. But I don't want to give people bad advice or give them the wrong thing. I was just wondering if anyone had any advice about this on some ways that I could start helping other people and that would help me improve too.\n\nThank you!", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "Answer questions for beginners -- ones that you feel completely confident answering. Don't answer a question about database management or web design if you've never done those things.  \n\nThis will ensure that you don't give the wrong advice, and that you still learn along the way. Help people with intermediate-level projects, or things you've done before.", "id": "e4tpra6", "replies": []}, {"body": "Don't answer if you don't actually know the answer. This may sound like a no-brainer, but I see a lot of people who have no idea what the answer is but want to feel helpful spamming question threads with low-effort and completely useless answers like \"I don't know, but here's a link to the top level of some vaguely related documentation; maybe the answer is somewhere in there, or whatever\". This is the opposite of helpful. Don't be that person.\n\nThis doesn't mean that there's nothing useful that you can contribute as a beginner. Something that experienced people are pretty bad at is remembering what it was like to be a beginner -- some things are so obvious to them now that they struggle to explain them to people to whom they're *not* obvious. You, an actual beginner, have a pretty good chance of being able to explain a concept that you learned and understood yesterday to someone who is struggling with it today.\n\nSo don't be discouraged, but also try not to bite off more than you can chew. Don't be afraid to say that you don't know something.", "id": "e4ts3h4", "replies": []}, {"body": "As others have mentioned, before answering double check your answers online to ensure that it is correct. With that said, eventually you will give wrong advice it just happens I've been helping people in online forums for over 10 years and I've had my share of moments where I was told I'm wrong. Take that as a learning opportunity and realize that the goodwill you intended is still there, just learn from the mistake an move on.", "id": "e4ttpwp", "replies": []}], "title": "Advice needed..."}
