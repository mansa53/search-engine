I know some matlab and c++ basics, and I will learn R and SAS, but I think only matlab and R are fine for data visualization. I also heard origin is great for that.\n* Would it be easier to use plotly online and that's it?\n* I found a library called mpl\\_finance, but it is unmaintained and not explained anywhere, may I give it a chance?\n\nWell, I think that's all.\n\nAgain, this is is my first post, make me know if I should change it  in any way.\n\nThanks :)\n\n\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "Maybe take a look at Julia.
