{"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9cnupo/very_basic_scripting_question/", "text": "At my job we have some txt files that some of our guys manually enter text for. Basically what they do is take a set of 10 txt templates that contain 6 lines each, all the same and change the 1st and 3rd line with a new value. It's tedious for them and has led to errors when they copy and pasted stuff. So for example all 10 txt files have this format:     \n\nClient: Client_Name      \nOffice: Our_Office      \nDate: Date_Client_Started      \nOffice Location: Our_Office_Location     \nTimezone: Our_Timezone          \nPhonenumber: Our_Number        \n\nFor all 10 I would change the values of Client_Name and Date_Client_Started to be the same variable. Can this be done with a simple windows bat file or what should I use to script this? I don't want an actual answer because I want to learn on my own can you just point me in the right direction on how to do this with which technology? Thanks.\n  ", "score": 4, "comments": [{"body": "Although this can be done in bash equivalents, a script language like Python or Lua will make it more pleasant, specially for a beginner \n\n", "id": "e5bymyu", "replies": [{"body": "Ok thanks I will start learning python. As a followup question, what I listed above is 1 part of a bigger installation process. There are a couple of tedious things that can be done through scripting I believe throughout this installation. Is the better approach to make many small little scripts the user starts up at certain times or should I make maybe a java program with a nice GUI with a bunch of buttons they can press when they get to the part that can be automated?", "id": "e5byvex", "replies": [{"body": "It really depends on the job.

Even programmers, and much more so regular people. So while you should develop and test it piece by piece, you may need a GUI to get them to use it. That may not even work.\n\nThe general problem area of filling variables into forms is called *templating*. You can get a long way with \"Find and replace `CLIENT_NAME` in five files\", but I eventually wanted stuff like \"if the customer has any addresses, loop over the list and put one on each line\". I went with Velocity from Java. I didn't find anything in Python that was as good for letting you take a text file template and replace everything like\n\n`    Client Name: $clientName`  \n`    Date client started: $dateTool.mediumDate`\n\nI did make a Java program like you suggest. First, the Jackson library let me put the input data in as JSON, which was easier than building a GUI. \n\n    {\"clients\": \n        {\"Bob's\": \n            {\"clientFullName\":\"Bob's Discount Bars\", \n            \"clientStartDate\":\"2018-09-01\"}, \n         {\"Bill's\": \n            {\"clientFullName\":\"Bill's, Inc\", \n            \"clientStartDate\":\"2018-09-11\"}\n    }}\n\nThat's also legal Python if you just want to do it like that.\n\nIf I do build a Web GUI (easier for me than learning Python's way), Spring Boot has [prebuilt Hello World projects](https://start.spring.io/) to get me going in no time.", "id": "e5citze", "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for this.
