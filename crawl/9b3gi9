I have been solving coding problems on leetcode in preparation for job interviews but am beginning to find that my lack of knowledge in dynamic programming, dfs and backtracking is hamstringing me. I reached for CLRS but I don't feel like the mathy explanations there are helping me when I actually get around to solving problems. I want a way more practical book, hopefully with a set of exercises in different areas grading progressively by difficulty to help me solidify my grasp on things.", "score": 4, "comments": [{"body": "The mathematical underpinnings are absolutely vital to any understanding of algorithms.
