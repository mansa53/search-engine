The more advice, the better prepared! \n\nHappy coding everyone! ", "score": 40, "comments": [{"body": "Congratulations! I am also a tester that would love to some day develop.

Maybe you can do some dev stuff during lunch breaks or take an hour after work to use the macs! \n\nI unfortunately had to move to a new company for a dev job because of the kind of development I wanted to do and they had no capacity for more devs, but I'm sure that if you tell them of your interest, they will be happy to help!

A big one for me was that it\u2019s OK to not know everything; ask, and ask a lot. The only thing not OK is to not be willing to learn.

I'll be sure to ask and learn as much as possible.

If you aren't bothered by repetition and enjoy investigating problems, it could be for you.\n\nUsually it involves refining requirements, ensuring the acceptance criteria is correct, then testing the software. \n\nAn example would be that we have a front-end for a shop and you have to test the basket page. The requirements state you can edit the quantity of the items as well as delete items from the basket.\n\nYou'd take those requirements and ensure that the implementation meets those and test for possible issues using techniques like boundary value analysis. (E.g. if you can edit the quantity, what are the limits? Can you put in 0? -1? How about a million?)\n\nI much preferred testing games when I used to work for a games company as I loved the culture and it was so much fun, although pay is much less than normal software testing and development. \n\nI can go into more detail if you'd like! :) ", "id": "e5d2wz9", "replies": []}]}, {"body": ".net core yay!
