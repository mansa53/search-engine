With Codewars, it seems like with more challenges I'm doing just that, searching the internet. I try and understand what i'm copying but once the solution has been submitted, I still feel like I'm not learning a lot.\n\nDoes anyone else have this kind of feeling or experience", "score": 4, "comments": [{"body": "But now when you are faced with a same or similar problem you will either:\n\n1. Not have to look it up and come up with a solution that works.\n\n2.

You need to work out the steps you're going to take to go from the inputs to the outputs and research any steps you don't know how to do, not the problem entire. \n\nPersonally, I think the real professional Python coder would be somewhere between the 1 line and 20 lines. Python is supposed to be readable, so unless the problem is amenable to something clever and concise like a list comprehension, longer answers are probably better.", "id": "e5d9mb2", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Don't copy and paste, if you must look up the solutions then do so but write the answer 'in your own words'.
