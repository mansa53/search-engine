I want to get into app development with xCode and maybe even do fullstack web development. Will this be enough for the task or should I pay 900$ more for the 15\" model that is also on sale?

When you're running the simulator the CPU will do the work, and the time it takes for it (and everything else) to open will be bound to the SSD (so, just make sure you get an SSD instead of HDD).\n\nOn college, some of my colleagues bought Macbook Airs for iOS development and were fine, some others had Macbook Pros from 2011/2012 and were fine as well.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDon't stress too much over it. As long as you have at least an i5 (bonus points if it's a quad core) and an SSD you're good to go.
