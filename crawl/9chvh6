{"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9chvh6/using_java_program_or_data_from_program_on_website/", "text": "So I wrote a program that performs well but isn\u2019t realistic in terms of being interactive so the next step for me is to use some of the data calculated and created by the java program on a website. Is there anyway to access the data I need without having to convert my entire program to JavaScript. If so, will the java run every time the website is loaded (what I want) or will it be a static thing that only will refresh when I manually do it? I am decent at HTML and CSS and a noob with JavaScript. I know that I can write to a html document within my java program but I feel that this would be sloppy and in poor practice. Any help would be greatly appreciated! ", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "As an example of something to do would be to click a button on the website and have it do x,y,z from my java program. I know that this is almost precisely what JavaScript is for but I don\u2019t have the time at the moment to convert it over because I hardly know JavaScript yet.", "id": "e5au2ky", "replies": [{"body": "Look into the [servlet spec](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/javaservlets.html) to do this simply.
