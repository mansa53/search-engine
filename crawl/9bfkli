There are a lot of video lessons and tutorials on YouTube for various languages, including C/C++. I would suggest looking through those first before dumping any money.", "id": "e52oo4l", "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for your help. May I ask the reasoning for starting C instead of C++.

", "id": "e52oyk1", "replies": [{"body": ">May I ask the reasoning for starting C instead of C++.\n\nI don't particularly suggest starting with C instead of C++. Rather, my suggestion is borne from the tutorial which is in C instead of C++. Both languages have their pros and cons and largely comes down to context and personal choice.\n\n>Also I only have mac's... do you recommend any free alternatives for that?\n\nI'm not particularly a fan of it (not my style), but /u/Limeoats has a beginner-targeted [tutorial series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETvApbD5xRo&list=PLNOBk_id22bw6LXhrGfhVwqQIa-M2MsLa) + a [subreddit](/r/Limeoats) which takes you through the process of making a video game (remaking Cave Story in fact) in C++.\n\nYou should be able to follow it regardless of what platform you're on.\n\n>I just learn at a better rate with organized structure if that makes sense. \n\nOf course it does. I do as well.\n\nHowever, just as a word of warning for the future: programming largely involves _a lot_ of undirected self-learning. At some point, you're going to _have_ to get comfortable with learning on your own at your own pace rather than relying on a resource to teach you in a structured format.\n\nAs a beginner, you're fine. Don't stress yourself out too much in these early stages. However you need to learn is best. Just keep it in mind.", "id": "e52peyg", "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I have not tried that course but it seems pretty well reviewed.  Just know they do a lot of sales so dont buy it just because it is onsale right now.  That said I have taken a few courses from them that I learned a lot from.  For $10 there isnt a lot of risk if you end up not liking it.  \n\n*reread question.  A lot of universities start with python or java now.  I personally think it would be best to just stick with python for now since it is what they are teaching.  Once you learn the basics of programming picking up a different language is much easier.", "id": "e53hzch", "replies": []}], "title": "First semester trying Computer science.
