I am 17 and am trying to learn how to code and it's pretty intimidating and confusing. How long do you think it will take me to learn and understand? How did you guys learn to code? Was it intimidating and confusing? Who taught you? How do you teach yourself?\n\nI really want to become a good programmer it is so fascinating to me, but so god damn confusing. I'm willing to put in the work, but youtube videos simply confuse me and I dont understand what I'm doing or how to go about it.\n", "score": 7, "comments": [{"body": "Take your time \nEvery one have a time zone \n\nProgramming is not coding \n\nProgramming rarely change \n\nCoding is rapidly changing\n\nPick python .

Now I've been working professionally for almost a decade as a software engineer.\n\nOne would think I'd have mastered programming at this point, but just before I jumped into this thread I ordered a bunch of books about software engineering. The truth of the matter is, you're never done learning how to write code.\n\nI'm saying this so you're aware there won't be some \"Eureka!\" moment and everything will become clear. You have to accept that being confused by a problem at first until you've researched it more thoroughly is part of the experience of writing software.\n\nBut you were asking what our recommendations are, so here are mine:\n\n- Don't do videos. They usually try to compress stuff, you can't control the speed of information or cross-reference with what has been said before. Not to mention that the information/time ratio is usually quite bad and so the producers try to reduce the material to an absolute minimum, which will deprive you of important information.\n- To start and \"get\" how programs work, I would actually suggest you start with a game. Something like \"Human Resource Machine\". Not only will it give you a good difficulty curve and instant visualization of your code, it's also an isolated environment that just works. No setup and configuration required. It's actually quite common to have students play games like this in their first lessons on software engineering.\n- Next step would be to either get a book for a language you're interested in (I'd suggest either Python or C, depending on how much you're interested in computer internals) or find a good tutorial online. The important part is to not rely on \"snippet\" tutorials. As a beginner they will start somewhere you don't understand and leave you standing out in nowhere when you're done.\n\nHope I could provide some insight.", "id": "e5d98gn", "replies": []}, {"body": "17 is early enough as is.
