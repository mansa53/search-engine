I just wanted to gather some input on what course I should take. I have the option of doing either HCI (human computer interaction) or a course on Program Analysis.\n\nThe HCI  is almost entirely a large group-project where you work with some sort of human-computer interface. Essentially, the main themes for this course are how humans with physical and information environments, and how to design software with human's information needs and their cognitive capacities in mind. The issue I have with this is that I'm also taking another project based course, and Operating Systems,  so I'm not sure if I could handle multiple projects in one term.\n\nThe program analysis course sounds cool (and theres no project) but I'm a bit intimidated of it since its a senior level. The course is supposed to give us an overview of the program analyses that work and those that do not work in practice and how to design program analyses for modern software systems (e.g., Android). Stuff like intermediate representations, interprocedural and intra-procedural analysis techniques, call graphs, pointer analysis, and analysis frameworks will be taught (though I'm not sure what any of that means).\n\n\u200b\n\nAny advice would be amazing! Thanks!\n\n\u200b", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "If you want to prepare more for frontend style roles, probably go with HCI.\n\nI you want to prepare more for backend style roles, security, and so forth, probably go for the program analysis course.\n\nIf you haven't taken a compilers course yet, I would be cautious about taking the program analysis course -- it's helpful to have first implemented your own programming language before you start dissecting them.\n\nIf you can take both (one class this semester, one class the next), I would try and do that. Both sound useful IMO.\n\nI would also strongly recommend you ask your classmates -- they'll have a better understanding of the quality and usefulness of those courses then we do. (E.g. perhaps it's the case that one of your classes is unusually high-quality or unusually low-quality, maybe one of the classes is traditionally taught by an unusually passionate and enthusiastic teacher or is taught by an unusually poor one...)", "id": "e4vfhar", "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for your advice! I really appreciate it. I can\u2019t really talk to my peers about the program analysis course since it\u2019s newly offered at my university, and from what they said about HCI was that it\u2019s a lot of work if your group members don\u2019t pull their weight. I\u2019m leaning towards program analysis more because I enjoy doing backend work more than I do front end. I can\u2019t do compilers yet since I won\u2019t have the prerequisites done until the end of this year, so I would be taking it in my senior year.  Would it be futile if I took it before I did compilers?", "id": "e4vgqku", "replies": [{"body": "> Would it be futile if I took it before I did compilers?\n\nI don't think it'll necessarily be futile -- I just think there's a possibility that it'll be a little more challenging since more of the concepts you'll be asked to work with are likely to be new to you.\n\nBut if the course doesn't list compilers as a hard prereq, you'll probably be able to manage.", "id": "e4vrv6e", "replies": []}]}]}], "title": "Confused about what course to take in my degree"}
