I looked at QT which seems to be the most common C++ GUI framework atm, but the examples looked super old school in appearance. I did notice that you could use c++ to create node modules and use them in JS in electron, would that be the best approach?\n\nI don't really care so much about cross platform, but that's a nice bonus.\n\n\u200b\n\nI have a lot of C++ language knowledge (initializer lists, RVO, RAII details, move semantics, even disassembly), but not as much general GUI experience (though I do know react JS), and the only GUI & C++ experience I have is with windows MFC and win32.... which are definitely not modern.\n\n\u200b\n\nAs for why, I love C++ and writing modern C++ is my favorite development work. I also want to make my own desktop apps, and would like them to have a modern flexible appearance and responsiveness (think slack, discord, vscode, ironically all being electron apps lol). I'm hoping I can combine these somehow, since I do also know a bit of react.", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "There are lots of options!\n\n1.
