I am wondering what is the simplest way to have an AI look at historical price data and (supposing repetitions in patterns) gives me the probability of an upcoming up or down move.\n\nI have really basic knowledge in programming (python/VBA) and I have heard a lot of different things to focus my searches on (artificial neural networks...) but I'd love to get more insight on how I could create the simplest version of a bot like that in practical terms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks so much in advance, this community is the best!", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "The most basic approach would be a logistic regression model (assuming I\u2019m understanding your problem correctly). Logistic Regression is a model that assigns coefficients to different input features and generates a categorical output (as opposed to Linear Regression, which predicts a continuous value instead).\n\nI don\u2019t really know what features you would need to generate meaningful results, but the most basic bread and butter approach is Logistic Regression imo.\n\nOther approaches could be:\n\n- Decision Tree (fast predictions, gets exponentially bigger as more choices are needed)\n\nI need to head out to dinner, but I\u2019ll try and give more detail on other approaches when I get back.", "id": "e56na0d", "replies": [{"body": "Thanks a lot!
