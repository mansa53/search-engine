I applied for it a few months ago, but I realized I didn't understand what SRE actually is. When I did more research I think Software Engineer is a much better fit for me.\n\n\u200b\n\nShould I tell my recruiter about this? Would this break my chance with Google?\n\n\u200b\n\n(I am interviewed as SRE-SWE, 4 coding interviews in C++ and one large system design.)", "score": 2, "comments": [], "title": "I have a Google interview for SRE, but I'd rather be SWE"}
