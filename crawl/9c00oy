I want to do something CS related during this fall/winter since I put off college until spring semester due to personal circumstances. I see the course started yesterday and I'm not sure how edx works so I'm not sure when the course closes, and I wanted to read a book called *A mind for numbers* by Barbara Oakley, as well as her coursera course that supplements this book since I heard its a great start for people getting into STEM majors. As someone who's never done much programming besides very light html/css(with a lot of googling and trial and error), is this course a viable, realistic option for a 3 month time frame? If not, would something like CS50's introduction to CS or teachyourselfcs.com be better?", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "If it were me, and I was simply trying to get an intro to programming, I'd buy a gaddis intro to python or c++ textbook and work through some of it. \n\nIf you get one new you get a license to the videos for the chapters which can be helpful. \n\nhttps://www.syl9.com/csci193/Notes/193eigth.pdf", "id": "e571jwn", "replies": []}, {"body": "It's an alternative to a CS class, so it would be the same level you should expect your class to be. \n\nYou could finish the course within two months comfortably, but you could also choose to learn Django/Flask and make some Python web apps.", "id": "e571s7b", "replies": []}, {"body": "Fyi Course ends Nov 1st.", "id": "e57q0fy", "replies": []}], "title": "I want to dive into CS before I start college for the first time in January.
