So the deal is, there will be Requests and Group of people. I want to assign incoming requests with an order to that group of people which also has an order ( not randomly). How can I create something like this? Can you recommend sources to check this kind of script creation please?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you!", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": "> I'm planning to create a simple script\n\nI'm not sure that it would be simple if you don't even know where to start.\n\n> have no idea which language would be proper to do\n\nUse whatever language you know. If you don't know a language, see the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq) for guidance.\n\n> How can I create something like this?\n\nChoose your language. Create a basic design (decide how it's going to operate, what actions the users can do, what data needs to be stored, what any UI will look like, etc). Write the code.\n\n> Can you recommend sources to check this kind of script creation please?\n\nI don't understand what you're asking for here.\n", "id": "e50y2gw", "replies": [{"body": "Well I was thinking about using python, but I'm kinda beginner.\n\n>Choose your language.

Write the code.\n\nBasically users wont do anything, They will just see if its their turn so they can take the requests from lets say pool. I mean the main idea is, there will be pool with requests, and the script needs to assign these requests to the group which is in order as list. \n\n>I don't understand what you're asking for here.\nI'm asking sample codes for that kind of assignation i mentioned above. And yes sadly I'm aware of that being not so clear. Sorry. \n\nLet me give you simple example;\n\n\nRequest 1\n\n\nRequest 2\n\n\nRequest 3\n\n\nThese are our requests in the pool.\n\nAnd I want script to assign these requests to group of people\nlets say ;\n1) George, 2) Owen, 3) Beckham\n\nSo script will assign the oldest request to the first available person.\nBut lets say George took Request 1, the script shouldnt assign Request 2 to George again. It should assign it to Owen and then the last request to Beckham. When the all people got their turns, Script should start over from the beginning again Which means from George. Let me know if you want to know more details.\n\nThank you for your answer.", "id": "e50z62m", "replies": [{"body": "OK, so it sounds like you have figured out how you want it to work.\n\nSo choose your language (Python is a good choice), find some tutorials for that language so you can learn the basics, then have a go at writing your program.  \n\nWhen you get stuck, feel free to post in /r/learnprogramming  - just be sure to write a clear question (see the [Posting Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/index) for how to write a good question).\n", "id": "e515kh7", "replies": []}]}]}], "title": "Creating script for ticket assignation"}
