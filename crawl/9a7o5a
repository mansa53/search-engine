What was it like, did it help you learn/get better?", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Self improvement only begins when you get past anxiety my dude.\n\nGo and just focus on the potential knowledge you will gain.\n\nAt the end of it not going will only add regret to anxiety", "id": "e4tbb5x", "replies": []}], "title": "Hackathons"}
