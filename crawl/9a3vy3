I can use the variable \"global\" anywhere in the program. Function Scope means the variable is only available within a function. Those variables which are declared within function at top. Block scope means  the variable is available within a block, example in above code the blockScope variable is only available within the for loop block. block scope and function scope variable are local variables meaning they are not available globally. i cant use them outside their function or block scope.", "id": "e4smknv", "replies": [{"body": "Adding onto what you said:\n\n(OP, play around with this code snippet.
