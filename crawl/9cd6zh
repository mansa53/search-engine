I'm not familiar with the domains of software engineering. I just want to go in a direction where I won't want to kill myself for doing the same repetitive task every day for 20 years.\n\nMaybe you could share a bit about your domain and how you like it compared to other fields you've worked.\n\nSome people tell me their work consumes their life, others say, as a programmer, their work day consists of mostly staring at their desk for an hour before doing anything as they have mountains of free time. I don't know where to find which. I don't know which fields are the most stressful and most lax. I'm a hobbyist, I love spending massive amounts of time doing personal projects or interests, as much as I enjoy programming, I'm not looking for it to steal all my life away.\n\nWhat direction might you point me? I want to be happy and most in control of my personal life, whichever field is more likely to take that away from me is a no no.\n\nTo add, I never want to be in a working environment where I have to compete for position or worry about sucking off higher ups. I don't like being at the whims of other people more than necessary. So I'm starting to think a corporate position isn't really in the picture, but what do I know?", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "This is a better question for /r/cscareerquestions ", "id": "e59va0r", "replies": []}], "title": "In school for SE.
