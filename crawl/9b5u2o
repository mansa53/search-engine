Because of the fact that 15+18 equals 33", "id": "e50n2n7", "replies": [{"body": "That is correct C should be 34. You incremented a in the line above. To start a was 17 then it was incremented by 1 so it's 18. In the next line a still has a value of 18 its doesn't go back to 17 so 18 + 1 is 19 then 19 + 15 gets you 34.", "id": "e50npsk", "replies": [{"body": "Thanks, but why is the output not 0=34 since c=0?", "id": "e50nwpv", "replies": [{"body": "C is no longer 0. When the line C = 15+(++a) is executed C becomes 34. These are variables so if you ever want to use 34 you know C is now assigned that value you can use C. For example if you wanted to do b + c you can and it will have the new values you assigned in the two lines above. Hope this makes sense.", "id": "e50o8y3", "replies": [{"body": "Thanks a lot!
