So they cannot be identical statements even though they appear to be at first use.\n\nEDIT: My hunch is that there is some imperative work done with a ref inside of a third party library.  This only happens when assigning it to a variable and using it later.  So if you know of any subtle differences between the two syntaxes that would be helpful.  \n", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": "What happens if you just do:\n\n    return variable;\n", "id": "e5cnjm2", "replies": [{"body": "Same issue.
