All these bots do nothing but add clutter to a discussion and are annoyances at best.\n\nFor us moderators, every useless bot means extra work.\n\nSo, if you decide to write a reddit bot, please follow [**reddit botiquette**](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/bottiquette) and thoroughly test it in **/r/test** before letting it loose.\n\nTo make it clear: **Every useless, commenting bot will immediately be banned**. If the **creator of the bot** can be identified, they **will also be banned** and **reported** to the **reddit admins** without any further discussion.\n\nReddit does not need any more stupid bots.
