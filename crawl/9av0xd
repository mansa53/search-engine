The codebase is huge and it feels like I'm just going down the rabbit hole trying to understand it, going from declaration to declaration. Also, they have me doing things I've never done before. I know they expect me to be learning the first few months I'm there but it feels super overwhelming. The first task I was assigned was some research and I can't seem to find what I need, is there some \"right\" way to google?  Sorry, I'm not saying what I'm working on, they have confidentiality and I'm not sure what I can or can't say about what I'm doing.
