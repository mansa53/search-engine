I'm currently on week 8 and I've been breezing through all the assignments. Am I a programming prodigy? Just kidding.... \n\nI have no experience in CS except for a very intense data science course I took in college where we utilized python. I feel as though I can build stuff in python or java fairly easily but I'm lacking in a lot of CS fundamentals. I'm not too familiar with a CS curiculum but can anyone recommend online CS course to kind of get that background?\n", "score": 1, "comments": [], "title": "Advanced MOOC's"}
