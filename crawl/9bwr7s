I see them only a few times on this sub so I was wondering if there a mega thread with loads of these roadmaps for different careers someone can link me to?\n\nThanks", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": "Here are some guides that I personally like https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides.

What I mean is the best programmers, engineers and architects aren't just coding in one technology stack and that's it. The people who move up in their careers understand the core concepts of software engineering and are able to apply them to any language that is needed. \n\nIn software development it's less about specific technologies and more about disciplines. Often it boils down to 3 areas of focus:\n\n* Technical. Software Engineer, Senior Software Engineer, Architect, Chief Architect ETC. These roles are heavily invested in the coding/technology aspect of the business. Understanding the need for specific methodologies and patterns.\n\n* Management. Manager, Senior Manager, Director, Senior Directory, VP of Engineering, SVP, EVP and CTO. This role is more focused on managing people and organizational structures. How the teams are formed and which strategic direction the companies need to take.\n\n* Product. Product Owner, Director Product, VP of Product, Chief Product Officer. This role is focused on building and evangelizing the vision of a company and it's goal in the marketplace.\n\nIt's common for people to switch disciplines, you're not locked into one. I know many that started with technical and ended up in management or product. I also know some that went product, then later decided to focus on technical work.
