[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) do that. I'm more interested in the title of the article and its authors. If that info is in the metadata of the pdf, then it is straightforward as there are already modules (in python for example) that do that. But when it is not a metadata, and it usually is not, I have no idea on how to go about doing that.\n\nA scientific article does not follow a structure. The position of the title, data, authors, and other info depends on the publishing group.\n\nHow would you go about doing what I want?", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Extracting any information from PDFs is hell.
