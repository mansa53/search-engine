If you wish to draw 2D shapes to the screen you may wish to look into DirectDraw, Xlib, or CoreGraphics depending on the platform.\n\nEDIT: DirectDraw has been deprecated since DirectX 9, which serves to show how outdated I am.", "id": "e50kxo9", "replies": []}, {"body": "You wouldn't use assembly for rendering graphics these days. As others said, you have to use a video card, which means you must use an API like opengl or directx.\n\nI suggest checking out [Handmade Hero](https://hero.handmade.network/episode/code), skip to the episodes/sections about rendering. He builds a cpu render from scratch to explain what the gpu is doing, but it's too slow ofc. So in later episodes he transitions everything to use opengl.", "id": "e50oryq", "replies": [{"body": "I din't atually think he wants to render graphics but want to write a graphic engine or something at that level at least. \n\n(Or is that actually the same?

That science and aspect of programming is so interesting to me.
