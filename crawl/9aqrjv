I make around $50k a year doing this, and I am generally unhappy as there is very little room for growth, and the people above me are making around $60k salary with added hours, so essentially the same as me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy company gives access to Udemy for Business. I've played around with it, but I don't really know where to start because I don't know which of these will actually benefit me as opposed to being a little hobby for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've researched a lot about bootcamps, going back to college for CS (I have a BA in Communication right now), self learning, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy end goal is to have a remote job where I'm making say $80k+ so I can spend more time around family, and then in my spare time travel around more. But I'm willing to put my years in at an office before being given my own reins. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm turning 30 in 6 months and I feel like I've wasted the last 10 years of my life, even though I have a house and a car and generally enjoy life, but I no longer feel challenged by my career choices, and I no longer feel satisfied with the income I make.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have a recommendation on Udemy courses I could learn to go into data science, app development, web development, etc.? Should I skip Udemy in general and go into a coding bootcamp? Just at a loss, and would really appreciate hearing from someone, or even better, getting to have a back and forth conversation with someone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all. ", "score": 4, "comments": [{"body": "Personally, if you're serious about it, check out a bootcamp or go back to school. Self learning can be really tough! You are making more right now than a junior dev would be making AND you are still far from a junior dev position. You've gotta make this choice. If you're just looking for 80k, then how about leveraging your experience to get a similar job with a higher pay instead? seems easier! ", "id": "e4xkdwo", "replies": [{"body": "Hey thanks for the reply! One thing about your post that I'm surprised about is the salary level. I see all these threads from people coming out of a bootcamp or graduating college and landing some 6 figure job right away. Of course it depends on where in the country you're living, but I didn't think there were any people in the coding world making less than 50k a year.

I'm 29 and just made a switch to tech. You can be in a different career in 1-2 years, and you'll still have another life ahead of you.\n\nComplete Web Developer Course 2.0 is a good course on Udemy I felt that taught me a ton. I did almost all of my learning on there. If you're interested in web, do [freecodecamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org) .\n\nIf you're interested in software dev, I would recommend Microsoft's virtual academy stuff and go from there.
