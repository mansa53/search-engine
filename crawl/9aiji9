They want me to review the following bullet points prior to my interview:\n\n\u2022 Hive Bucketing & Partioning\n\n\u2022 Spark RDDs\n\n\u2022 Dataframes\n\n\u2022 Dataset differences\n\n\u2022 Spark vs MapReduce\n\n\u2022 Data warehousing\n\n\u2022 Star Schema\n\n\u2022 Table Join basics\n\n\u2022 AWS\n\n\u2022 AWS Lambda Functions\n\n\u2022 Kinesis vs Kafka\n\nI have a few questions for you guys with experience with Big Data companies.\n\n1.) When it comes to partitioning and bucketing, does the company want me to learn the basic concepts (ie. what they do) or learn how to make queries with the two?\n\n2.) When it comes to the technical part of the interview (ie. code in Python), what exact concepts should I review exactly? I'm aware I have to know basic join tables, AWS Lambda functions in Python, but what else? \n\n3.) Where can I review AWS Lambda functions online?", "score": 5, "comments": [], "title": "How can I prepare for my Big Data technical interview?"}
