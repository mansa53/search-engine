Initially, I set the interview far out in order to prep (About a month out). However, I've recently been contacted by a start up company who wants to push forward with interviews as well. I don't want to miss out on either opportunity because both have great upside. Google is Google of course, and the start up offers a different set of welcome challenges technically. \n\nI'm debating on moving my phone screen up, but I'm still a bit hesitant because of the Algorithms/Data Structure subject matter. Most of my knowledge in that area is self study(Cracking the Coding Interview/Leetcode/MIT open courseware and others) and I guess the nerves are kinda getting the best of me. I will say that the phone screen is \"supposed\" to be front-end focused, but I'm not exactly sure how much. My recruiter also mentioned that the phone screen will be/ should be done in JavaScript, but it might be easier to code (for me) in python. \n\nSorry for rambling, there's alot going on in my head.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR I have another company interested in interviewing with me along with Google. Should I move my phone screen up?", "score": 4, "comments": [{"body": "I would move the phone screen up. A month out is pretty large.
