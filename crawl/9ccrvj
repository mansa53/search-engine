I decided to take on a much higher-level language though. Recently I've been wanting to start learning C++ again, but I don't have any ideas of what to make so it's hard to motivate myself. Could you guys throw some ideas out there for a program that I could make to motivate myself to learn the language?\n\nThanks!", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Have you read through the FAQ for ideas?
