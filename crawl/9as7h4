I've heard great things about getting a solid foundation in other languages and basic skills (Python, c++, data structures, algorithsm, API, encryption etc).\n\nDoes anyone have good suggestions for free/affordable resources to expand my programming horizons?\n\nI am trying to build a fundamental understanding of computer science, while still learning and practicing useful tools.\n\nI'd like to find some good websites, communities, pdfs, tutorials, and videos to expand my knowledge.\n\nI've found stackoverflow, github, reddit, hackernews, and reddit to be useful, but i'd like to find more specific and high quality resources to read and practice on.\n\nThanks!!", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "So you've been exposed to front-end exclusively and want to expand your horizons.
