If you would like to work writing firmware for embedded systems, controlling hardware, then learn C.\n\nBut that certification doesn't seem to offer C; besides Java it offers C# and C++, which despite their names are really better described as Java-like languages intended for the same sort of applications. They are not C variants. C++ is the least Java-like, but even though it has features compatible with C, I doubt that's the aspect they will be teaching in those classes. Given the database- and web-related classes, the whole program seems to be oriented towards \"enterprise\"-type programming, not hardware.\n\nJava and C# are both easier to learn, and more useful in that field, and I think Java is the biggest one (although I don't work in that field). If you want that particular certification, I think Java and C# are probably the better alternatives.\n", "id": "e4vaq1f", "replies": [{"body": "Ok good to know! Thanks for the in-depth response.
