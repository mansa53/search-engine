I just found this little game where you place buy and sell orders on randomly generated stock prices to try to beat the market and ... interesting part: to try to beat their AI.\n\nI would love to know what AI/technology/language do you think they use to be able to create such a bot. I am not much of a programer but I believe it would give me great insights for my thesis to know how this has been built and to potentially build it myself. \n\nThank you guys in advance!\n\nlink: [https://www.stockit.tech/](https://www.stockit.tech/)", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": "Looks like it's not AI per se, but just automation that buys and sells stocks according to an algorithm (as opposed to an actual AI which can interpret input and make decisions)\n\nLooks  like a lot of the functionality of this is in JavaScript (specifically React) and the code is viewable in chrome dev tools.\n\nWith all that said, today there are many resources to use AI and machine learning in applications including offerings from cloud providers like AWS and Azure.", "id": "e56chyl", "replies": [{"body": "No way ahah!
