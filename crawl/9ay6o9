I connected to DB succesfuly and all is working great. Now I want to start to build some methods. I guess i will start with one simple method - Query. Can someone point me to nice tutorial, where I can see how it works, where and when apply fetch and etc. I know that i can check lot of tutorials in youtube, but I hate that in the end I have the same method as in the tutorial and didn't write method in my own way,  it still works fine, but i want to make my own method and understand what should I apply in each steps. Hope you guys understand what I mean and sorry for bad English , its not my native.", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": "Query is really generic and probably not suited for a DataBase class, since PHP already has that function built-in. It is better to not re-invent the wheel. There are already plenty of classes that can run queries for you. PDO is a great example of this.\n\nInstead, you should try to do something that is a bit more specific. You probably have a good idea what data you want to extract from your database. You should try and write a class that does this for you. If you have a table with users, you should write a method that returns all details of a user given a certain username. That way you can add actual value to your DataBase class without rewriting other peoples code.", "id": "e4zle0x", "replies": [{"body": "Yes you right, I can do staff with build in query function.  Your idea about specific method that can return data from DB is good. But I have an Product class too what I later will use with my DB class to make some simple Product catalog with functions to add and delete Products.   \n\n\nIts good to make a DB method for example only Select, Update SQL functions ? ", "id": "e50ue5e", "replies": [{"body": "Yes. Making methods for Select and Update statements is a good idea. Try and build your methods in such a way that you can use the same method for fetching user information and for fetching product details, by providing different parameters.\n\nUpdate and Delete goes in much the same way. You can add extra checks here to make sure that you can't delete user information for example.", "id": "e51scfz", "replies": []}]}]}], "title": "PHP OOP DataBase class"}
