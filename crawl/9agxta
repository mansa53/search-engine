I've never seen a 'from' and 'to' function though nor can I find any documentation on it. Where can I find more info on that? Also, I'm generally confused about the rest of the code, like what does webkit-mask-image:webkit-gradient do? Why do we need another line called mask-image?", "score": 3, "comments": [{"body": "When in doubt about what something does, [take a look at the documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask-image). \n\n`mask-image` applies an image mask to an element, and [`linear-gradient`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/linear-gradient) specifies how the image mask is applied. As you can see, it applies a linear gradient to the bottom of the image, fading out as it goes.\n\nThe `-webkit-mask-image` line does the exact same thing.\n\nHowever, the syntax definition of the `mask-image` CSS property is still not official yet, and is subject to change. That's why some browsers (in this case, Webkit browsers (like Safari, and formerly Chrome)) implemented their own version of these properties. Basically, if you've ever seen properties that begin with `-webkit` or `-moz` (for Gecko browsers like Mozilla Firefox), those are browser-specific implementations.\n\nThe reason why they are both here is that some Webkit browsers may not support the official `mask-image` syntax yet, and so if not, they can fall back to the `-webkit-mask-image` version. Same thing with `linear-gradient` and `-webkit-gradient` (the latter supports legacy syntax which no longer matches the current spec).\n\nSo `-webkit-gradient(linear, left top, left bottom, from(rgba(0,0,0,1)), to(rgba(0,0,0,0)))` is just a  Webkit-specific way of writing `linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(0,0,0,1), rgba(0,0,0,0));`. \n\nAs for syntax, unfortunately it seems Apple removed their documentation page for `-webkit-gradient`, but [this page](https://www.the-art-of-web.com/css/linear-gradients/) lists it as\n\n    -webkit-gradient(linear, <point1>, <point2>, from(<color>), color-stop(<color stop>), to(<color>));\n", "id": "e4vd8y7", "replies": []}, {"body": "[https://css-tricks.com/css3-gradients/](https://css-tricks.com/css3-gradients/)", "id": "e4vd912", "replies": []}, {"body": "It seems you may have included a screenshot of code in your \npost \"[Can someone explain this line of CSS code to me?](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9agxta/can_someone_explain_this_line_of_css_code_to_me/)\".\n\nIf so, note that posting screenshots of code is against \n/r/learnprogramming's rules: please **edit** your post to use one of the \n[approved ways of formatting code](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_formatting_code). \n(Do NOT repost your question!
