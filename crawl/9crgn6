I think I love it to much though, whenever I code I find myself losing track of time and spending up to 8-10 hours straight on a computer, losing out on the day.\n\nI don\u2019t work, but am financially stable, I code some self made projects to help the world with some issues.\n\nI find myself coding without keeping track of myself. Does anybody have issues with this, or possible solutions. When I\u2019m in my zone, I just focus and can\u2019t get out of it until I get tired.", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "Does setting an alarm on the phone work for you?", "id": "e5ctf6u", "replies": []}, {"body": "These are problems I'd love to have, with that much effort the skill will come sooner or later.
