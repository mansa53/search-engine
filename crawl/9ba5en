For most relational/SQL databases, that interface is mostly the same (though the internals may be quite different). So don't think of it as \"what database should I use with C++\"; think of it as \"how do I use relational databases in C++\".", "id": "e51gwa8", "replies": []}], "title": "C++ mySQL database connection?"}
