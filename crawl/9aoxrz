The data is in String format.\n\n**Data Example**:\n\n    \"status\" : \"present\", \"description1\": \"2P MTR M-F 7:30-16:00\", \"description2\": \"2P MTR M-F 18:30-20:30\", \"description3\": \"2P MTR SAT 7:30-20:30\", \"description4\": \"2P SUN 7:30-18:30\", \"duration1\": \"120\", \"duration2\": \"120\", \"duration3\": \"120\", \"duration4\": \"120\", \"endtime1\": \"16:00:00\", \"endtime2\": \"20:30:00\", \"endtime3\": \"20:30:00\", \"endtime4\": \"18:30:00\", \"fromday1\": \"1\", \"fromday2\": \"1\", \"fromday3\": \"6\", \"fromday4\": \"0\", \"starttime1\": \"07:30:00\", \"starttime2\": \"18:30:00\", \"starttime3\": \"07:30:00\", \"starttime4\": \"07:30:00\", \"today1\": \"5\", \"today2\": \"5\", \"today3\": \"6\", \"today4\": \"0\"\n\nI have a 3000 data set. I need to output a different result for each set.\n\n**For example :**\n\n    if (current time between fromTime_1 and toTime_1) and (current week day between fromDay_1 and toDay_1) \n\n**output:** description\\_1\n\n    else if (current time between fromTime_2 and toTime_2) and (current week day between fromDay_2 and toDay_2) \n\n**output**: description\\_2  \n. and so on for all the 6 conditions.\n\nThe other part is I also wanted to display different img on the screen for below conditions:\n\nif  \n (current time between fromTime\\_1 and toTime\\_1) and (current week day between fromDay\\_1 and toDay\\_1) and status = Unoccupied \"but i need to check if the status is = present\" and duration\\_1 = 15 \"but duration might be 60 or 120 or 240 and that is output a different img in regarding to the time and the status\"\n\n**output:** imgGreen\n\nelse if  \n ... same for all 6 conditions.\n\nWhat is the best way to filter my data, I have not much experience in this type of data filtering so please help.
