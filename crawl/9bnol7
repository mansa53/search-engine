{"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9bnol7/i_feel_as_if_ive_been_going_in_circles_for_months/", "text": "Little background: I recently graduated from a bootcamp where I learned Python and a speciality language, which I thought was going to be javascript but they ended up just teaching us jQuery. After graduation I learned CSS and javascript by myself because I wanted to work in the front-end. My portfolio is basically non-existent, just random games from tutorials and some projects from the bootcamp. I've been searching for a job this past month and after several phone interviews realize I am severely under-qualified. I recently got laid off from my old job as well so that adds some pressure from my gf/ family to focus on landing something soon. \n\nMy problem is I start off with an idea (like create a responsive portfolio website) and get overwhelmed by researching all these different technologies like adobe/wordpress/flexbox/css grid/ bootstrap. So I spend about a week learning flexbox, then learn I need a bundler and pre-processor so I research gulp and Sass. I am really having trouble sticking to one project without looking at job postings and seeing they need someone with wordpress experience so I try to learn that, then I realize my javascript isn't as up to par as I'd like so I spend a couple days reviewing promises and the fetch api and then I come up with a new project I'd like to start and the process basically repeats. I've been doing this for over a month now and nothing to show for it. I've read about tutorial purgatory and the easiest way out is to start building something, but I'm getting stressed seeing all these things I don't know and feel like I can't really do anything. \n\nI'm sorry for the rant, but I just don't know where my priorities should be at this point. Should I focus on creating a personal website to show employers or should I work on more projects for my portfolio? Any advice on which direction I should be going would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading, sorry it was a bit long. ", "score": 4, "comments": [{"body": "Most employers are going to be more impressed by your ability to get something done, than by your list of specific technologies that you know. I think that's your biggest mistake.\n\nAn employer will care about front-end vs back-end. If they're looking for a front-end developer, they will care that you know JavaScript and CSS. But they really aren't going to care if you know Sass, that's something you could easily learn on the job. You don't *need* Sass. Another company might be using LESS, SCSS, or many other solutions.\n\nIf they're looking for a back-end developer, then familiarity with Python, PHP, Ruby, or Node would be expected. But if you know PHP and they use Python, I really don't think it's a big deal. If you know the important concepts, like working with a database, you'll be able to pick up a new language.\n\nRemember the phrase, \"Jack of all trades, master of none\".\n\nSo: one good project to show off is your highest priority. More important than a list of technologies, a portfolio of little things. A portfolio of one is more than sufficient if that one project is good.\n\nSo, focus on something and finish it.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "e54dbbo", "replies": [{"body": "Thank you!
