But with everyone learning how to be a dev, I'm getting worried the market will be oversaturated. I'm learning everything at blitzkreig speed, but I'm unsure about the future if the economy tanks, or dev salaries are now reduced to peanuts and dust, or dev roles are being exploited more for less money. To be clear, I love development and it's also what I do as a hobby; I didn't just start doing dev work because I wanted money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, what do you guys think?", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": ">Is anyone ELSE worried about the influx of new programmers\n\nIf you've only been doing this for 1.5 years, you're *part* of that influx.\n\nIf we were worried, do you think we'd be here helping new programmers get started? There's room for more in this field; I'm not threatened by the availability of programmers. We'll never be to the point where \"everyone\" or even most people learn to program; that's a nonsense pipe dream that some people are pushing.\n\n>but I'm unsure about the future if the economy tanks\n\nWelcome to the real world, where everyone is always worried about their economic future, regardless of profession. There's no such thing as a completely recession-proof industry, but companies always need programmers.", "id": "e53peav", "replies": []}, {"body": "Evolve with technology my friend.", "id": "e53o9tn", "replies": []}, {"body": "As far as I'm aware there continues to be a shortage of programmers and only a very tiny proportion of people ever learn to program; if I were to guess I'd think it's less than one percent that get any formal education, but practically every single employer needs to employ programmers, either directly or indirectly. You're probably only noticing the great number of low-skill *web* monkeys that are directly competing with *you*. But web developers have been a dime a dozen since the 90s.\n\nIn any case, what problem do you see? That it will be too easy to find competent programmers? Or that it will be too hard to find the competent ones because of all the incompetent ones? And that this will cause society to waste resources on an unnecessarily large number of job interviews?

Its impossible to accurately predict which jobs is going to be 100% safe and lucrative for the entirety of your working life.

Once you've picked a path, you're better served by committing to it than constantly worrying and making course corrections.\n\nAlso, the fact that entry level recent grads make 80-120k depending on location is kind of an anomaly; if dev salaries come down, that seems more like a correction than a crisis.", "id": "e53ojon", "replies": []}, {"body": "Everybody learns to write these days,  and there are still room for authors, and pretty much everybody reads and writes on the job.
