I was recently laid off from my previous job at a brick plant (labor job), willingly bc they ended up offering me another poisition but I opted to take the money they were going to give me. I'd say its enough to survive for 6 months, might be able to stretch it more working odd jobs.\n\nMy quesiton is, how should i focus my time. Should i shoot for an IT job? How much easier is that than shooting for a junior web developer? I am willing to put in a lot of time everyday to do this. If i can shoot for the stars for a web development, I would like to but I would just like some advice I am pretty new to the industry. I hear that html/css/javscript is a good starting point.

We have two \\*highly\\* competent TA's in our program who are both still searching for a job but because they have a job (not a programming job), they are likely counted in the placement number.\n\nI can give you a long list of resources that our Web Development Bootcamp has assembled - many of which are at a cost much lower than what you'd pay for the Bootcamp.  The Bootcamp will constantly remind you that the value you derive from the program is equal to what you put into it, but I think that applies to learning a dev language, in general.  \n\nThe choice is really up to you but there are way too many freemium resources out there - that you shouldn't have spend $17,000.

I'd say those rates are pretty accurate as it's been 3 months and my cohort has about the same rate. I'd bet it'll rise to about 70% like in the report in 3 months.  \n\nYeah it's definitely a hefty price tag. I would say the main benefit is the network you get, from your cohort and the bootcamp's larger network. I think self-study is an option, but I think it's also a lot harder because you have no structure as to what exactly you should be studying everyday. I didn't find much success doing the self-study route and I wanted results fast, but I also had a CS degree. IMO FreeCodeCamp isn't that great, because the curriculum is long and boring (not to mention they just have you dive straight into exercises without diagrams, which I think are really helpful for React and Redux), and they don't tell you that you don't need to know/remember everything that's being taught.  \n\nObviously you should do your research but I think Hack Reactor is probably your best bet given your location.  \n\nAlso regarding Texas, I know a dev online who works in the area.  \n\n>Look into how friendly they are to your point in your career and cost of living\n>For example Houston and Austin are both good Tech Cities, however in Houston if you don't have 3-5 years of experience you're gonna have a tough time, vs Austin where juniors are desired more than seniors (given the dynamics of companies relocated there from CA and most of their seniors staying in CA).  houston has a significantly lower cost of living than Austin.

Getting at a decent enough level to join as junior in just 6 months time isn't easy. Extending your budget from 6 -> 8+ will make things significantly easier. The effort you put through in a day doesn't scale as well as the long term effort you put. You can learn only so many things in a single day and you need to digest them.\n\nYou gotta be committed all the way through otherwise might as well not do it. This is the reality, it's going to need dedication. There is reason programmers and IT get paid better than the rest is because it isn't an easy feat to learn to program but it's worth it.\n\nSo as for learning and getting into the industry, the first thing you should do, imho is to go through CS50, https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x.  \n\nIt's a damn good course and it's suggested for a reason.  \n\nThe next step should be to build a portfolio.  \nhttps://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x  \nhttps://github.com/tuvtran/project-based-learning  \n\nSince you don't have a degree, building a strong portfolio is necessary.  Pick a project from those that seems interesting and try to implement it, doesn't matter if it's not the same language as what you know, do it in what you know. Knowing a language at level 7/10 is a lot better than knowing 10 languages at level 4/10. It takes time and effort but it will help you get better at programming, a lot faster than you can imagine. \n\nThe last step is to learn data structures and algorithms. Go to a local library and look for this book: https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition or get it through other means... Many professors and universities swear by this book and there is a pretty darn good reason they do. It's a good book.\n\nThis book is what will get you through the interviews.  \n\nAll of the previous should take around 10 months. Socializing and building a network is also necessary since you have no background. But, by this point you should be able to get into a startup. Getting into a startup is much easier than at established firm since they have the opportunity to be a lot more flexible on whom they hire.\n", "id": "e4twfzo", "replies": [{"body": "Thank this was very helpful.
