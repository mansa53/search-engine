If the file is in a different folder in the same place as the `*.cpp` file then you can specify the path of the file: `#include \"folder/file.h\"`\n* Specify the absolute path of the header file in your include statement as: `#include \"path/to/file.h\"`\n* Tell CodeBlocks to search a specific directory for header files when compiling. To do this, go to \"Settings -> Compiler -> Search directories -> add\" and add the path to the folder that the header file is in.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "e4tg9d3", "replies": [{"body": "I was trying to do the third option but I thought it was weird that if you choose a directory it wouldn't parse through the folders in that directory to find the files.\n\nI've been getting an error:\n\n    #error This file requires compiler and library support for the \\\n    ISO C++ 2011 standard.

You'll need to set the `-std=c++11`(or the newer `-std=c++14`) flag first:\n\nGo to \"Settings -> Compiler -> Compiler settings -> Compiler flags\". You'll see a list of flags you can enable. If you're using the latest version of CodeBlocks(recommended) then you'll see a checkbox titled `Have g++ follow the C++14 ISO C++ language standard [-std=c++14]`. Enable it.
