Thank you. :)", "id": "e4rqgla", "replies": [{"body": "While Python is definitely slower than compiled languages like C, C++, or Go, it is fast enough for most CRUD web applications since the biggest delay is I/O related. Things like database queries and HTTP traffic will typically be much slower than the actual Python running your logic. I would really recommend Django for what you are proposing. If your application is going to be doing a lot of computationally demanding task, you may need to go with something faster than Python.
