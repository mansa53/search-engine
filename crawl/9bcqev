{"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9bcqev/first_website_woo/", "text": "I saw a good post yesterday (with some good feedback) about someone who had made their first website, and I wanted to show my first, it's for a product design studio I'm opening.\n\n[https://newformstudio.com/](https://newformstudio.com/)\n\nThe website is intentionally basic (because of both inexperience and aesthetic reasons), I like Muriel Cooper, Jaqueline Casey, and International Typographic Style (ie all the helvetica) and websites like [http://act.mit.edu/cavs/](http://act.mit.edu/cavs/) , [http://www.6a.co.uk/](http://www.6a.co.uk/) etc. (basically websites that let the content do the talking). I absolutely wanted to avoid a website that was obviously a cookie cutter theme/ template (although for all I know, I could have totally made a theme looking website), and I wanted to push myself to execute something of my own design, but simple enough that I could do it without giving up. \n\nThe markup is a little scrappy as you might expect from a first website, it is responsive (although I'm having trouble with logo and text margins on the about and projects pages on smaller screens).\n\nThe shop page is under construction (shopify) and the links to the shop don't work yet, just the c name.\n\nAesthetic choices;\n\nNot that it matters so much on this sub, but I went with the Tim Berners Lee hyperlink blue and red colourscheme, black text, and off white background (easier to read than pure white) with a pure white border. Aesthetic choices like these are purposeful - Helvetica, the most ubiquitous standard font, so that the content does the talking. Left instead of center align, as a nod to the [first ever website](http://info.cern.ch/) (which seriously didn't give a shit about style sheets), another design choice that lets the content do the talking. All the imgs taken by me, logo was designed by me, as with everything else on this project so far.\n\nI just did this because I wanted to learn it, and I'll probably hire a web dev/des to redo the site with a shop etc as soon as this studio is running etc, for now I'm cool with it. I also taught myself because I thought that; when I do pay to have the site rebuilt, I'd know if I was being ripped off, ha! \n\nI heard that actual programming is more logical than web dev/ css, which I found at times completely nonsensical, and made me want to better understand the underlying processes of it. I'm gonna teach myself some Python for automation etc next, hopefully that will be a bit more logical.\n\nLmk what you think, I'd appreciate any constructive criticism, thanks!", "score": 4, "comments": [{"body": "Some constructive criticism:\n\nYour background image is huge and takes quite a while to load. Consider a different format than jpg, like webp or something smaller.\n\nYour background image is also not actually a background; you should actually embed your image as a background of a div rather than as an actual IMG tag, and you certainly shouldn't make the entire image a link.\n\nMargins and padding needs work. First, you've got a lot more visible margin than I expect you wanted, since the body has `8px` of margin by default, in addition to the extra divs you threw in for padding. Which, by the way, is unnecessary and somewhat bad practice; you could easily center your main content and just use the box model (margin, border, and padding) to space everything out.\n\nYou've also got both vertical and horizontal scroll showing by default, meaning you're pushing your content a little off-screen.\n\nI'm going to mess around in a codepen for a bit and edit in a link to show you a few of the things I'm talking about.", "id": "e523n41", "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for this, I was completely ready for the first comment to be \"this is shit\". I'm new to this and kinda just winging it, so thanks for replying with a solid answer. I've watched lots of Lynda, youtube tutorials, done freecodecamp, but wanted to avoid copying anything verbatim so I designed pages in illustrator and went for it, ha.\n\nI do know how to make my background img an actual background, but found that I couldnt make a css background a clickable link, so went with that. I think you're probably right about a huge background image link, the img its self (desktop) isnt brilliant to be honest, maybe I should rethink that. I had been trying different ideas, and i'm not extremely happy with it, but it was the last attempt that I was reasonably happy with so I stuck with it. I need a few ideas with that. From a Graphic Design point of view it's kinda a monstrosity also haha.\n\nYou just taught me something. Didnt know that the body had 8px of margin by default, thanks for that. Is there somewhere I can read about the box model you mentioned? I tried to find good resources but apart from moz and stackexchange I couldnt find anything more than just css properties do etc. I do want to understand how things affect eachother, it's been frustrating working without that background understanding. I was originally using dreamweaver, but hated it, so just used brackets instead. I tried to figure out bootstrap and I read some stuff on grid table layouts, but it kinda went over my head because I didnt have the background knowledge. I know my margins arent good, I'd love to know how I can do better.\n\nI quite like the white margin, I think it's a cool frame, kinda makes it look like a letter or pdf. If I came up with a better concept I'd get rid of it though. I dont mind it being not conventionally laid out. A similar website would be [https://www.benjaminedgar.com/](https://www.benjaminedgar.com/), which has a crazy red frame around stuff. I think it's cool!\n\nI'm not sure how I pushed my content off screen, I've been using viewport width and height, but I know it scrolls for some reason that I dot understand.\n\nAgain, thank you for the solid reply, I appreciate your help.", "id": "e5260x1", "replies": [{"body": ">I was completely ready for the first comment to be \"this is shit\"\n\nI'm not going to lie to you and tell you it's beautiful. But it's your design. A lot of the things I'd tell you look bad are the things that you're saying you like or think is cool, so shitting on that isn't going to be constructive. But this is not a bad first effort, and you're using certain techniques that I feel like some people should learn (like `vh`/`vw` units, for example).\n\n> but apart from moz\n\nMozilla Developer Network is the actual official documentation. [Here's a good place to start](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Containing_block).\n\n>I couldnt find anything more than just css properties do etc\n\nThe \"box model\" just refers to how those css properties work together to provide what is basically the containing box of an element (margin being outer spacing, border being exactly what it sounds like, and padding being inner spacing).\n\n> I was originally using dreamweaver, but hated it\n\nNot surprising, Dreamweaver is hot garbage.\n\n>I'm not sure how I pushed my content off screen, I've been using viewport width and height,\n\nWell, in some places you've used `vh` for width, which is actually the height unit, so that's causing some problems. Just noticed that.\n\nAnyway, here's a codepen I've worked on for you. This should show you how much less code than you have that you actually need to produce a layout like that:\n\nhttps://codepen.io/insertAlias/pen/qMqEOp\n\nEdit: one last thing. Your header image is **huge**, compared to the size you're showing. Make an appropriately-sized image. Or better yet, don't make text into an image. Make a `svg` (a vector image) of your logo, and that can scale to whatever size you want it to. Then you can just use relatively sized text and a logo to go with it.", "id": "e526w9p", "replies": [{"body": "Whoever you are, whatever your name is, you're an absolute fucking geezer.

Fromt-end web development is a big part of my day job, yes, and I've been doing it for a good while now, so it does come easier for me. I know you've talked about having a developer do everything for you, but I encourage you to continue working on your own skills. You obviously have a liking for it, so I say challenge yourself and keep on going. Maybe work with a designer to come up with a mockup that you can work towards implementing. They can help you turn your ideas and inspirations into something that still feels modern but includes all your design elements. I know that design is my own weakest area; I generally fall back to Bootstrap or other libraries and focus on functional but simple designs. Which is OK in my line of work, since I'm writing internal software for businesses. The interfaces don't have to be beautiful because I'm not competing with anyone for attention. They just have to be functional and easy to use.\n\nAs to putting in the effort, I've been answering questions on various forums since my first programming job. I've found that I've learned more by trying to solve other people's problems than I have my own. Really, it's broadened my perspectives and introduced me to various things I'd never have sought out on my own. So when I have down time or need a break from a project, it actually helps me clear my head by thinking about other people's problems, and I grow as a developer. I encourage everyone to participate by paying it forward; once you're more comfortable with what you're working in, help someone else out the same way.\n\n>Whoever you are, whatever your name is\n\nSometimes I honestly wished I had made a different reddit account with my real name, because at this point I've stopped participating almost anywhere else on the site, and some of my best contributions have been under a fake internet name that I try not to connect to real life haha.", "id": "e52b6f1", "replies": [{"body": "Hey you're a super nice person, thank you. I do want to carry on learning to code etc, I honestly appreciate the encouragement, I havent had any from anyone else (the quirks of starting a company solo I guess) so it means a lot.

I'm gonna pursue developing in some language or another though, just because I like to understand how things work/ how to making things.\n\nI hope you know that you really did help me today, starting a company alone is hard and teaching yourself something challenging (that you intend to use) at the same time is almost stupid. I've come close to giving up and having someone else do it or using squarespace a few times, so thank you for reassuring my stubborn ass. \n\nWe both have annon names, classic internet scenario, haha.
