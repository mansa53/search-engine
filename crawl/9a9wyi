Bill to use up, but I put off college in lieu of working full-time. Now I\u2019m a manager with some more control over my schedule, and I\u2019m revisiting my degree. I work for a tech company and started doing some programming during my off-hours, and I found that I really enjoy it.\n\nMy background is really more like commercial HVAC, so I always thought I\u2019d go back for mechanical engineering; however, the accredited options weren\u2019t good when I had the time, and when I lived near a brick-and-mortar college, I didn\u2019t have the time...but CS seems more forgiving with remote courses and options.\n\nI have some college, though it\u2019s a mix of good and bad grades. I had to move a lot (economy/federal contracts in early 2010\u2019s), so my transcripts are spotty and I never stayed in one place for more than a full semester. My transcripts are like half 4.0\u2019s, and half W/F depending on when I needed to drop a semester due to employment. With that I\u2019m kind of afraid to apply to schools (and I\u2019m not about to entertain a for-profit online school that would take anything). Some colleges may also give credit for some of my military coursework.\n\nI\u2019m not interested in coding boot camps or anything of that sort. Career-wise, it\u2019s better if I can finish a bachelors degree, and since I\u2019ve enjoyed programming, it seems a natural fit (not to mention that it\u2019d be a waste of my G.I. Bill if I didn\u2019t use it). Any suggestions?\n\nThanks!", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "I've been down this road. Left the Cream Corn in 2014, finishing up the bachelors in a week and heading to grad school in the fall. Here's a list of shit in no particular order.\n\n* If you can afford it, take community college and pay out of pocket for whatever gen-eds you have left. This allows you to work more slowly, (you aren't spending benefits while you flounder around in English 101) and possibly have a better commute and more online options.\n\n* Going with this - set up an appointment with the undergrad CS adviser **at the four-year college**. Take all of your transcripts, failures and all, and figure out what will transfer, what you have left to take at the CC, what you can take online, and what needs your ass in a seat at the college. Don't get it from a community college adviser; at best, it's secondhand, and at worst, it's a load of bullshit.\n\n* The bulk of upper-division CS classes are in person and are demanding. You can get away with taking the basics online if you're smart and already have a technical background, but most colleges don't offer things like Computational Structures online. Colleges that do are most likely setting up their students for failure.\n\n* If your job is really flexible, you can work full-time through the duration of your degree. That's what I did, and I count myself extremely lucky that they gave me the opportunity to do so. Other jobs are not as forgiving, and your best bet is to take as much as you can slowly, save up your money, and then do the remainder as fast as humanly possible. The GI Bill allows you to do this thanks to BAH. Depending on your living situation, you might have to take a little bit of student loans, but it's far better than the situation that most people have.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.", "id": "e4tw0az", "replies": []}, {"body": "/r/cscareerquestions", "id": "e4tz0c7", "replies": []}], "title": "Working full-time, want to finish college.
