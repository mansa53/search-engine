A lot of people have ideas, but being able to actually translate that to a given language is huge. This just takes practice coding some projects both large and small.\n\nKnowing why you coded the way you did is important as well. If I said \"design a program that calculates the Nth number in the Fibonacci sequence\", there are a multitude of ways you could code that. However, only a few ways will be miles and **miles** ahead of the others with regards to performance (we are talking exponentially increasing time vs linear time).\n\nBasically, learning how to translate your thoughts to code is huge AND learning how to put thought *into* your code is huge.", "id": "e57lipd", "replies": []}, {"body": "Basic computer skills and basic problem solving are the fundamental  pre-requisites along with the mindset of \"I wonder what happens if I push this button...\"", "id": "e57ln9f", "replies": []}, {"body": "3 things.\n\nA) The ability read.  \nB) Patience.   \nC) The ability to put your ego behind.  \n\nFor the last, it's not directed specifically towards you, but to anyone willing to learn to programming.", "id": "e57p19c", "replies": []}, {"body": "If you're learning to code, you're super far from the point where your knowledge of math or typing speed will be your bottleneck. \n\nThe only skill you must have is the ability to learn things by searching the internet.
