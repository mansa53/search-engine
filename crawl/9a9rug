I'm a terrible programmer. I've managed to land some big internships, but I've done very poorly because I can't grasp the concepts. \n\nI have a year left in school, and in this year I'll be taking: Programming Principles 2, Data Structures and Algorithms/Database Applications, Computer Architecture, Web Development etc.\n\nI like programming, I just have a *huge fear of failure*. I know if I can overcome this I can be successful because I'm smart-- I just don't know where to start. I'm graduating next December, and in May or August (so exactly 9 months to a year from now), I want to be able to get a job at a place like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, Slack, etc. \n\nI wanted to know what some of you did to drastically improve your skills. I know I have to practice but I don't know how. What classes can I take online? What YouTube channels helped you? Did you just program? Did you take notes? What about UDemy courses? And how did you structure this studying in your free-time? Any good books? Anything I can try to build on my own to test my skills?\n\nI really want to be better, and I appreciate any help you all can give me. Thanks so much.

I don't mean this to minimize the way you are feeling in any way, just saying that you are not alone in this.\n\nIt is great that you want to improve your skills, that mentality is one that is key for successful software engineers.\n\nPersonally here's what I do to improve:\n\n* I code a lot. Doesn't have to be building the next big thing. I practice using websites like codewars or codingbat. I also pick small projects to work on. Often these are hobby driven and derivative, but that's ok.\n\n* Watching youtube does help, but does not replace the need to code.\n\n", "id": "e4tsu6g", "replies": [{"body": "oh i haven't heard of either of those! how does codewars work? i'm really looking for a website that has coding challenges that adjust to my skill level so i can keep improving. and thank you so much for your kind response, i really appreciate it!", "id": "e4ttqej", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "/r/cscareerquestions", "id": "e4tz060", "replies": []}, {"body": "https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/\n\nNot sure if you'd be interested in something like this but it will make you a better programmer and help you get over your fear of being rejected.", "id": "e4u91z0", "replies": [{"body": "this is a really cool idea, thank you!", "id": "e4w5v7s", "replies": []}]}], "title": "Getting a Job in Silicon Valley"}
