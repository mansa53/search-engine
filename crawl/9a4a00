I haven't had my own time trying to learn the language, so I can't do much better than just dump a bunch of links:\n\n* [learn.adacore.com](https://learn.adacore.com/index.html), an in-development, modern web resource following in the steps of the Rust books.\n\n* [ADAIC's list of learning materials](http://www.adaic.org/learn/materials/), listing a series of textbooks available for purchase or free download. [Ada Distilled](http://www.adaic.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Ada-Distilled-24-January-2011-Ada-2005-Version.pdf), listed under Ada 2005, gives itself as an entry-point to the core language for those with some degree of programming experience.\n\n* [There's a Wikibook for Ada programming](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ada_Programming), though it's on the side of being an incomplete reference.
