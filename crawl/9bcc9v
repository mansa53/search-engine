Working as an in house senior (not sure my skills equate to my title but whatever) agency dev doing a lot of custom Wordpress / Shopify builds. Have built some production React projects but am no way an expert. feel like i have tapped out, all the work we do is the same without ever learning anything new. I want to advance my javascript skills and progress into Software Engineer / Front End Engineer on a product team.   \n\n\nDon't think I am interested into going to hack reactor or similar.   \nThe biggest thing I want to learn more is advanced Javascript. I know SASS very well, know webpack, babel, grunt, git etc. Know PHP in the concept of building custom wordpress themes.   \n\n\nA lot of my learning with javascript comes from jQuery. Whats the best method for me to continue learning, do I just choose some courses on Udacity / Udemy and go for it? Work on javascript bootcamp prep work? Try and pick up more React jobs?", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Build your own stuff. You know enough by now that you should be able to challenge yourself.
