We're wrapping up *Eloquent JavaScript* now and I'm here to announce our second season!  \n\n\nStarting September 2nd, we will begin Season 2! We're going to double down with two more awesome books that should attract you whether you're **a CS Major with a few years under your belt looking for more meaning in life** or **a green developer that just picked up some basics and is interested in getting a firmer grasp on CS concepts**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the higher level learners, we have:\n\n**\"Algorithms\"** by S. Dasgupta, C. H. Papadimitriou, and U. V. Vazirani   \n \n\nFor the fresher folks, we have:\n\n \"**The Imposter's Handbook\"** *by Rob Conery*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the JS Junkies, we have:\n\n**\"Eloquent JavaScript\"** *by Marijn Haverbeke*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***What's the format?*** \n\nThe format of the book club is asynchronous, with chat channels for each chapter to keep the discussions focused.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***How quickly do you read the books?***\n\nThere is a cadence chosen for each book and weekly reading reminders are sent out via an announcements channel, but there's really no pressure. The goal is to complete the book within the 3 month season, but we're not going to quiz you or bug you to do your homework. Your reading pace is totally up to you. Since the chat channels have history, and the members tend to stick around, you can always get questions answered about earlier chapters if you fall behind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***I've already read these books!***\n\nIf you have already read one of these books and would like to mentor, we would appreciate the help!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***How do I join?***\n\nWe hope you will join the book club, suggest books, ideas to improve the community, and invite your friends!\n\nJoin here:  [https://discord.gg/9wgAGwn](https://discord.gg/9wgAGwn)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nDev Book Club Discord Server: [https://discord.gg/9wgAGwn](https://discord.gg/9wgAGwn)", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "No slack :(", "id": "e5383i9", "replies": [{"body": "Discord is like slack but better.
