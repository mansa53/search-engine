To give you an idea of what I'm trying to build, I set up a fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/ag3xtboz/\n\nEssentially, each user will have one row each (represented by authenticated user in Firebase) and they can log hours worked for their respective row and day. I wish to store this in a Firebase database by hitting the submit button. Cool, so far, so good.  On submit, data is stored in node like this: https://prnt.sc/kppd9t \n\nHere's where the cookie crumbles - since Firebase automatically puts it at index 0 (since I'm pushing an array of objects to firebase) - I have a very hard time retrieving and updating that specific node. Obviously I only want each user to be able to update their own node, and not someone elses\n\nI have a hard time making the whole `Submit hours -> fetch correct node -> update hours in correct node` work, because if there is more than 1 user in the parent node in Firebase, the array will now not only hold 1 user (represented by **`rows`** if you check the fiddle), but both, and trying to submit something just makes everything a mess, since it pushes the whole array, so it creates something like\n\n\n    userId1: { \n        0: {\n            name: name1\n            times: {\n                times1\n            }\n        },\n        1: {\n            name: name2\n            times: {\n                times2\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\nWhere user2 is nested inside user1...\n\nI think I have tangled myself deep in some sticky web and I don't know how to proceed from here.\n\nI'd greatly appreciate if someone can help me structure this a bit.. \n\nThanks a ton", "score": 0, "comments": [], "title": "Can someone help me structure my Firebase / Vue JS app?
