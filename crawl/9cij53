I don't remember Sublime requiring a license to save documents when on Windows but I could be wrong. Is there a built in MacOS IDE that I'm missing out on?

The distinction is very important OP. Code editors provide an interface to type your code and check for errors and syntax highlighting. You don't get debugger, compiler etc. Example - Visual studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text etc are Code editors. Pycharm, Intellij etc are IDE. \n\nIf you want a code editor, I suggest visual studio Code over sublime text and atom. Sublime text feels a little lighter but the extensions visual studio Code has is amazing. Sublime text is free in a way. The original license costs about 80 dollars but if you don't buy, it doesn't lock you out. Every 30 saves (i think. But im sure the number is below 100), it asks you to unlock. You can cancel it and continue working. Very much like Winzip.\n\nVisual studio is completely free.
