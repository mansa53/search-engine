{"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9cpdbp/cant_get_past_the_beginner_stage/", "text": "Hi, I'm 20 year old and I've started to learn programming about a year ago. I know a little bit of C, Python, HTML, CSS, JS, Assembly and Bash shell. I'm okay at solving problems, and I know the basics (I can manipulate integers, strings, booleans, arrays, lists, if statements, for/while/repeat loops, functions, pointers... etc). But I feel like I don't have have the skills to actually build a project (website, app... etc). I took a bunch of MOOCs and watched a lot of tutorials, but I always feel like a complete beginner no matter how hard I try. Any advices on how to go from beginner to intermediate? ", "score": 7, "comments": [{"body": "Find a tutorial/mooc/course that goes from zero to having something tangible built, then make sure you put all of your efforts into completing that course 100%; don't stop until you have completed the course. Treat the project as something that NEEDS to be done. If you get stuck, trawl Stack Overflow, trawl forums, go through all of the trial/error you need to do, ask people etc. Going from beginner to intermediate will mean putting in extra effort to get the project complete (no matter how small the project is), and testing various ways of doing the same thing until you find the solution that you need. Don't be tempted to jump from course to course hoping to find the perfect one because there isn't one. The key will be persisting in the face of all of the bugs/issues you will encounter. \n\nIf it helps, don't think of levels as beginner and intermediate etc. Think of it as simply people with varying levels of experience. The only difference between you and a more experienced programmer is that the more experienced one will simply have done more, completed more projects, debugged more, and essentially learnt more along the way. You may feel like a 'beginner' for a long time, but the key is persisting in the face of those feelings, and having the will-power to continue learning.", "id": "e5caqk1", "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for the reply!
