My big dream is to be able to contribute to great projects (especially in the open source community) like Linux, Wine, Tools etc. It usually goes like this: I buy a book for beginners (most times from Rheinwerk Computing), start it and never finish it. This just happened to me with my Python book. I feel like the last chapters didn't stick with me all and were just: \"Oh, we have this thing, with this function and here is an example, moving on!\" At the beginning there were exercises, but there haven't been any lately. I know I am supposed to play around, but honestly that's an issue I have as well: I just can't think of a project that I would like to pursuit while keeping my focus. On the other side, most GitHub projects are too complex for me. I don't really use any tools myself that I could contribute to.  \n\nMy question: How do I continue from here? New language? New book? Or is programming not the real thing for me?\n\nLook forward to your replies <3", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "I used to feel this way too. I would recommend taking a look at learning X the hard way.
