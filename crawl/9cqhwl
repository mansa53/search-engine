I managed to buy a copy of Tanenbaum's MINIX 3 book with the hopes of studying the first couple of chapters over the summer and learning how the kernel works. Unfortunately, I ran into a road block when it came to the actual code (as opposed to the theory presented beforehand). I realized I did not have enough knowledge on the i386 chip and its relatives. Some things that it posed that I had no idea about: *caches, TLB, segments and segment registers, string instructions, descriptor tables, interrupts, traps, IRQ, partitioning, privileges, vectors, selectors, addressing modes.*\n\nSo now I am trying to find out what are some good books that will teach me assembly language and intel's architecture. I am assuming I will most likely need to know both the application and system side to these intel chips. I have checked for a manual online but it seemed to assume that I already have some assembly knowledge which I do not. Another related question is whether I should first look at 8086 before studying the i386 or should I jump right into the i386? \n\n**In short, what are some good books you'd recommend for learning i386 as an assembly noob and what books would you recommend to learn the system architecture and especially the topics listed above?**", "score": 1, "comments": [], "title": "Books and other resources on i386 and intel processors"}
