While immersing myself in tech stuff I came across an interesting piece of advice from an early interview on the Code Newbies podcast: making a blog to mark your progress as you continue to learn. \n\nI\u2019ve gotten myself a Wordpress and done a couple posts. I\u2019m wondering though if anyone has good examples of similar \u201cpersonal learning journey\u201d blogs? I\u2019m just wondering what typical posts cover and what pitfalls to lookout for in the content I post. \n\nIf any of you keep a blog similar to this I\u2019d love to see it. If it\u2019s not in bad form to do so I can link mine here as well.", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "Just be real to yourself and your experiences.
