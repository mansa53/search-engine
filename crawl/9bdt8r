This library does not take layout into account at all, i.e. if you resize a window none of the sizes or positions of GUI elements are changed. Are there any libraries out there that handle ONLY layout/layout calculations, without actually handling the GUI. For example, I could pass in position/width/height/size/layout rules variables, and then have the layout library calculate the appropriate size/position/etc. upon new GUI elements being added or the window changing size.\n\nIf not, are there any tutorials regarding a good way to implement (at least a simple version of) this?", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Yes, there are lots of libraries that do that, but they tend to be specific to each platform.
