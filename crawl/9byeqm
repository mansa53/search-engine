Currently learning SQL, then JavaScript.\n\nWhat exactly do I have to... do? I don't quite know what requirements I need, or what kind of experience or knowledge I'm missing. I'm worried i may not even know what I'm missing.\n\nIf anyone could help me with things that I can do to:\n\n1.

Something like that, it would be good to know Arm, C, C++ and Python.\n\nFor other industries, that requirement may differ. There you might want to know how to use Java, or layout with Html. All that.\n\nNY best recommendation is to try and imagine where you want to work at as a Software engineer, and what you want to work on. Look at similar job postings and see what they are asking on the resume.

Focus on depth of your skill set rather than the breadth of it. I'm not saying don't learn more things, but rather than doing \"hello world\" and make a dummy class in five different languages, read code written by other developers and try new things in the language you already know. Porting that over to a new language isn't too arduous, and most good employers know that. Having a good understanding of several concepts in one or two languages is better than understanding one or two concepts in several languages.\n\n2. Get some projects on your GitHub. Personal projects are great, but to actually inspire you to write them, make it something you're interested in learning and hopefully using. Look at some things written in cpp or python, then emulate them, play with them, make them your own. Add features. Break features. Fix them.\n\n3. More of a continuation here and something I still don't do but I know I should, contribute to some open source. Think about it, it's pretty much point number 2. Fork an open source thing on GitHub somewhere and play around with it. Maybe you realize you can add a feature or clean up a few functions. Either way, you're reading good code and hopefully writing some too.\n\n4. The most obvious, but apply for jobs and follow up. A ton of posted jobs are dummy jobs, fulfilled internally, or posted on wild hopes they'll find an outrageously great candidate. Don't feel insulted if you get turned down. I really like my job now, and I was lucky. I think I only applied to roughly 30 jobs before I got it.

It allows people with non traditional CS backgrounds to attend a 5 week bootcamp and then spend the next 11 weeks as a full time employee. If the LEAP candidate does well, it will result in a full time job.  You are paid the whole time decently well (see the website).  We have a few on our team with varied backgrounds, including one who was a biology major in college. Some of them worked in different fields for a few years (2-5) before deciding they wanted to pursue a CS career.  One was an army medic for 4 years and another was a biologist for 2 years before joining.  We have enjoyed the various candidates we have received through the program.  \n\nEven if you don't meet the listed requirements perfectly, I know some candidates have made it through and been quite successfully without having met all the requirements stated on the website. The most important part in my opinion is that you are eager and willing to learn.\n\nhttp://www.industryexplorers.com/\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I am a Microsoft employee, and these comments and opinions are of my own and do not necessarily represent Microsoft's.

Granted, that's a lot \"closer\" (whatever the hell that means) to CS than history, but still not a degree in CS. I work full time as a software development lead now. \n\nThe real short answer here is simply: get your foot in the door. Get in to a company that you know is making the kind of wizbang shit you want to do. Take a job a level or two lower than you think is appropriate for you if you have to, take a job in IT if you have to, but get in there. Razzle dazzle them with your competence. AND DONT TAKE YOUR FOOT OFF THE GAS. Seriously, work hard and have the right answers at the right time, and make sure folks are noticing. Ask for a transfer, and hopefully you land it. When you do, hit the afterburner. Make those people regret not having you around years ago. \n\nI know this solution requires a lot of internal dependencies, and it may not be the way you accomplish your goal, but I wanted to give you the perspective of at least one way it could be possible.

Often these are shitty companies to work at, because your peers will be the result of a hiring process that doesn't focus on what you can actually *do*. The best companies focus on the later, and often could give a flying fuck about your papers. I'm a senior architect with decades in the industry. Never finished high school. My resume doesn't even have an \"EDUCATION\" section and most people never ask.\n\nBy the way, your story is extremely common.
