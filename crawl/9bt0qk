Thing is, I live in a second world country with 30% unemployment and I have been unemployed for most of my life because of a sickness. I finally got cured, started eating right, started working out and kicked the depression that came with my disease. I have a degree as a software engineer but to say that I am lost and a bit scared is an understatement. I need a way to make something that I can show, since so far I have just learned from the Helsinki MOOC, online courses and books. I'll make a LinkedIn and GitHub profile but I will have nothing to show there. I'm sending CVs to all the companies that are looking for a java developer but since almost half of the experienced Java developers left the country, I started learning Java (again, I did no university, but that was a long time ago) so that I can get a job. Now every company here is panicking because they need experienced Java developers and they don't want to give us noobs a chance. I would even take an unpaid internship if it gives me a chance. I just need somebody to tell me what to learn after Java core and a solid OOP foundation, I have that, now how do I implement it. Help.
