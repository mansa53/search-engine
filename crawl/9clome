I can't make the background work exactly like in the video. I tried using some pie animations, but these don't work well with it.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Could you guys help me, please? It would help me a lot. And I'd be very grateful. :)*", "score": 0, "comments": [], "title": "Help: Web preloader in style of old movie counter"}
