Why standing on the path far ahead, on which she is trying to walk do I need your help, you would ask? That's because I didn't start programming until my sophomore year at college. I had a fairly strong background in mathematics and physics and I never faced any difficulty in picking up coding. But again, I did come across fellow batch mates who were far ahead of me in the game.\n\nThat makes me wonder would the situation be any different had I been coding from a younger age? Would it make any difference at all? I would like to think yes, but then I don't know how to guide her.\n\nP.S. I've already gone through her school curriculum and i'm not quite convinced with it -- they have basics of Logo, QBasic and HTML.", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "I think the most important goal for anyone young learning is a goal, something they want to do. Simply wanting to learn programming is usually not enough motivation. The best thing you could do is find some sort of fun project with a tangible payout. Something like a small game or website. Anything that they can see grow and develop visually.\n\nFrom there it's all about building the project piece by tiny piece like you probably would yourself when learning a new framework.\n\nI think learning programming early is great. Even if they don't become programmers it teaches a valuable form of problem oriented thinking which will be an asset in pretty much any field.", "id": "e4yoye2", "replies": []}, {"body": "Find something that interests her and try to link it to programming.

I realized that I would really love to have a website to which users can register etc. At school I had a bit of python but those were just the very basic basics:) I first started from a WordPress website: I watched a youtube tutorial on how to build one. Thanks to that I build my first basic website! However that wasn't enough - i wanted to add some more functionality to it. I kept on researching stuff experimenting with it and somehow I managed to build a beautiful website to which users can register and upload posts. But then I realized that WordPress is just too easy and boring, and I decided to learn programming in order to build websites completely independently. The only thing I knew was that websites were build using html, css and js. I had completely no idea how the css is linked to html etc. So I started researching... I learned basic css and html very quickly, but realize that it actually wasn't 'real' programming. So I started learning JavaScript. At first I tried codeacademy, but I didn't really like it cause it didn't really teach me js in practice. It didn't show me how to use it in building websites. I asked on Reddit and someone recommended me watch and code. Right away I realized that that was the thing I was looking for. It not only taught you js but also shown how to build a website using it. After I finished the basic watch and code course I build some personal projects just to practice. But I realized that I want to build a website that actually uses a DB. So I started researching again. I learned about the front end and the backend. On reddit I asked about the language I should choose to learn for my server. Someone told me that since I already know js I could learn node. I looked for a good node js beginner tutorial but could really find one. Then by some kind of luck I found The Net Ninja's youtube channel, and learned node from his tutorials. After that I build a simple full stack website, which basically was a stopwatch that records and stores times in the DB (no auth). Throughout it I faced many problems (mostly async code), but whenever I wasn't sure I just asked on Reddit. Then I started learning oAuth, and I built another simple websites to which users can register. Few weeks ago I started building a bigger website where users have their own accounts, they can submit comments and posts as well as like content. I spend all of my free time programming. Every time when something isn't working or I am confused I ask here, thanks to that I learned a lot. I am 100% self-taught.\n\nSo looking at my story, she has to find an aim, something that will motivate her to learn programming. Without that motivation she probably won't enjoy it.\n\nHope I helped :)", "id": "e4yru24", "replies": []}, {"body": "She can learn all the basic concepts of programming by making games. Try downloading Construct 2 and then go through the first tutorial. It's really easy once you get the hang of it. And get Paint.NET for the easiest way to make transparent PNGs to use as sprites.
