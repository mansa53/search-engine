The offer is expired now but if there is space in the program it is likely that I will be able to get myself switched into that program. \n\nOn paper, at a glance it almost seemed like a no brainer to switch into the 4 year program for the better credential but I was hoping to get the opinion of someone more experienced than me in the field. \n\nSome things that also have me reconsidering my decision, 4 years means I will graduate one year later, which means more time spent in school, and more tuition to be paid. The three year program not only means I would graduate a year sooner and hopefully get into career a year a sooner, but I will also get the co-op 3 semesters sooner, which I find to be the most attractive thing about staying with this 3 year program. \n\nI will try to get some second opinions at my college tomorrow, not sure from who but I will ask around. I hope some of you might share insight or opinions to help me make a more informed decision because I'm not really sure which would program would be the better one for me to enroll in. \n\nI am hesitant because it feels like I am choosing between getting into a career more quickly or taking my time to get a better credential without really knowing how either path will actually work out or differ in reality.\n\nThanks in advance, and huge apologies if Im being invasive by posting this in the wrong subreddit!", "score": 6, "comments": [{"body": "The majority of companies in the industry will not consider you for serious roles without a bachelor's degree or years of experience.
