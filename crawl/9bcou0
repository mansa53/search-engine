I'm thinking about taking a comp graphics class for my last semester.\nAnd the course description is as follows: \n\n>In this course, students study the mathematical foundations and essential techniques in the field of modern computer graphics.\n\nCentral topics include modeling and meshes, viewing transformations, graphics pipeline, lighting models...and graphics hardware.\n\nThrough both guided and self-directed learning opportunities, students gain experience with industry-standard programming interfaces and tools, and develop an understanding of design and implementation of 3D graphics >applications.\n\nI'm an Interactive Design and Game Design major, who is interested in Front-End Development. I kinda hate theory and math, but am investing time in topics helpful for front-end on my own (algorithms/data structures?)\n\nIs there a lot of  mathematical programming? Will I be able to apply what I learn to front-end? Thanks for the help", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "~~Doesn't seem like a programming class, so I'm not sure how much insight you're going to get in this subreddit.~~\n\nMight be wrong about this.", "id": "e5206ez", "replies": [{"body": "Okay, so its mostly Computer Science?

Graphics programming tends to involve linear vector transformations and projections and the like.\n\nIf it's anything like the Computer Graphics course I took, it'll be pretty interesting. There's not much \"mathematical programming\", but there's a bit of underlying math that you should understand when you do graphics programming.\n\nAs for applications in front-end (I'm assuming that means UI/UX) design: unless you're going to do 3D graphics programming, there's probably not much you can apply.", "id": "e520rfv", "replies": [{"body": "Okay I can do that.

I mean, you do lots of geometry and algebra to draw scenes, and then follow some algorithms to make ray tracing work, but I don't recall it requiring developing or deducing your own solutions.\n\nBut that was many years ago and only a single example.
