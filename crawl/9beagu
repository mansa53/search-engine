Now this program will run on a Ubuntu server, and it will record some information into a text file. How would I be able to make it so that I could edit a text file and be able to sync and edit the file on the cloud via something such as Google Drive on Ubuntu. Is there any other easy way other than having to log into the server everytime I want to see what my bot has saved?
