I instantly joined a big big project, (lots of code, 1senior, 1 junior, 1sys admin, 2 fronteders and me (intern) ) I was given to write unit tests, fix some sort of bugs (I only knew some concepts about the web and basically python) either those bug were fixing tests, fixing bugs in development or bugs in production (small ones like give back more data from the backend, adding serializers or smth like that), all of the tasks were super hard to understand since eveyrthing is writen beyond my understanding , very dynamically and with lots of stuff i havent even heard of or seen.", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "If they wanted someone who knew what they were doing, they would have hired a professional with experience.

Then tell them your approach and what you\u2019ve done technically to try to acieve that, i.e increase a counter, then tell them and show them exactly your source and stack traces.

Read the errors, the fastest way from junior to senior is reading errors.\n\nOften i need  to tell my interns to read out loud word for word the error says so they see that the answer is already there.\n\nThe feeling that you know nothing is normal.
