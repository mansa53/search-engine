I\u2019m in an intro object orientated programming class and doing C# in Visual Studio. There\u2019s an assignment, I wrote my very first lines of code! Happy geek dance! Question. The check points show every line returning values through the auto screen with a breakpoint on the very end; when I run and debug, my auto screen only shows the last line. I\u2019ve googled it and saw info that says it only shows the prior 3 lines but everything else from my instructor and random googles show I should be able to see every line executed. Which is it? Did I miss some setting during the initial install?", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "You need to set a breakpoint at the beginning of the code that you want to step line by line through. The code will run until a breakpoint is hit and then you will have the option to step through or resume until the next breakpoint.", "id": "e58zv1k", "replies": [{"body": "I have def ran through with my own breakpoints set. Maybe that\u2019s what they did. I just assumed that set the breakpoint at the last line + it should look like this would coincide. Perhaps not!!!", "id": "e593s1k", "replies": []}]}], "title": "Visual Studio Question"}
