Improve, refine and repeat until you outsmart all your opponents and friends online.\n\nYou can watch the trailer on the [website](https://gladiabots.com/?ref=rd_learnprogramming).\n\n\u200b\n\nProgramming has been a passion for me even before I tried it. I've been programming for nearly 20 years now (OMG I'm so old), not bragging I'm good at it (far from it), but I kept that love for the virtually unlimited creativity you unlock as soon as you write your first line of code.\n\nBut I also know that learning a new language from scratch can be quite a daunting task. That's a big part of what motivated me to make this game: giving access to this creative power without the hassle of memorizing all the details that make a programming language.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe game has already been used by several teachers in class rooms to teach the basics of the programming logic to students who never touched programming before. I've shared pictures of it in [this thread](https://forum.gladiabots.com/viewtopic.php?t=1193).\n\nThat's why I thought it may interest some of you guys. Let me know if it helps some of you too! ;)\n\n\u200b\n\nCheers,\n\nSeb/GFX47", "score": 131, "comments": [{"body": "Thank you guys, hope you'll like the game.\n\nHere are a few steam keys: [https://imgur.com/YfpKS5U](https://imgur.com/YfpKS5U) (sorry, I don't share text version to avoid key bots)", "id": "e4ranib", "replies": [{"body": "Keys gone and no one says thanks lol!
