Also sorry if I wasn't clear, here's the problem from the book:\n\"A two-dimensional random walk simulates the behavior of a particle moving in a grid of points. At each step, the random walker moves north, south, east, or west with probability equal to 1/4, independent of previous moves.

Take just the case for `i`: you continue looping while i < 2N OR i > 0.   Every single possible value for `i` is either greater than 0 or less than 2N,  so it will loop forever.\n\nYou need to continue while `i` is in the range 0 -> 2N and `j` is in the range 0 -> 2N\n\n    while ( i > 0 && i < 2*N && j > 0 && j < 2*N )\n", "id": "e56f5kp", "replies": [{"body": "ah ok thanks", "id": "e56favi", "replies": [{"body": "Also, you have a bug on line 25, if you adjust to use just a single random number per iteration - look at the values you're comparing your random number against.\n", "id": "e56fjk2", "replies": [{"body": "O crap thanks again!", "id": "e56fn04", "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "An OR (||) means that if any of the conditions connected by an OR are true, the entire statement is true.\n\nSo, (A || B || C) is true if at least one of A, B, or C are true, and false only if all are false.\n\nYour while loop is set up to run endlessly unless all conditions are false.\n\nHope this gives you a clue.", "id": "e56fbyi", "replies": []}], "title": "Java: while loop won't stop"}
