So to give back story I'm a 16 year old high school junior that has completed algebra 1 and 2 and currently taking Pre calculus. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, my question is what programming language should I learn? I'm interested in programming video games when I'm older and I want to know where I should start. Thanks!", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": "I would suggest starting with a scripting language like Python (or maybe Ruby).\n\nI would imagine people are going to recommend JavaScript but I just can't do that in good conscience (at least not in 2018).  Some college courses start with Java or C++ but I've always thought those are poor first languages because they have some annoyances and quirks that can be distracting.\n\nGood luck!", "id": "e5cdx2e", "replies": [{"body": "Oh, and also check out the FAQ for this sub, specifically \"Which programming language should I start with?\"\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki\\_which\\_programming\\_language\\_should\\_i\\_start\\_with](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_which_programming_language_should_i_start_with.3F)", "id": "e5ced9w", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Definitely python.
