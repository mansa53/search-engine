For example, I practice guitar by playing along to a drum machine, but I wish I could have human elements added to drum loops, like auto-fills and occasional variations and so on. What would it take to do that? I could start by writing a simple drum sequencing program--one without a GUI--and see how it went. I also take a lot of photographs, and I could use a tagging scheme that isn't tied to a do-everything program like Adobe Lightroom. That's simple enough that I could create a minimal solution in an afternoon.\n\n>The two keys: (1) keep it simple, (2) make it something you'd actually use.\n\nFor bash specifically, I wouldn't go out of your way to make projects in it. Just keep an eye open for small repetitive tasks that are a good fit for shell scripting.", "id": "e54qfc4", "replies": []}], "title": "Coming up with ideas?"}
