How difficult would you say keeping a database of players, their levels and in game items and keeping it secure from hackers is? I don't have any programming expertise, I'm just trying to get an idea of how difficult this is because it is my goal to make something similar.

Assuming you've already done something like this before and are an experienced programmer, they aren't really technically difficult to do or take an extreme amount of time. But if you are starting from 0 it's impossible to say how long it would take.", "id": "e5cx5fi", "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, I phrased the question wrong. What i really wanted to know is what level of knowledge would be needed for this? Like a bachelor's of comp sci maybe?
