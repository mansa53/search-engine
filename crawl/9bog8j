Basically it gives you the english word and you type the spanish. Unfortunately we have to do 10 of these...each averaging around 40 questions...and that's just for 80%. We need to do 12 for the other 20% (stupid system, ik). I've gotten pretty tired of it especially since one of them has NINETY(90) words. What programming language would be most useful for making a bot to autofill for me? I've heard good things about Python and Java but I am open for suggestions. I would also like it to be universally useful (useful for most stuff>", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": "Por que no los dos?\n\n*snicker*\n\nNo, seriously.

I can't speak to how you would solve this in Python (although I'm sure it's possible), but in Java I would scrape the question using something like Selenium, translate what you get through a English->Spanish library (don't know one specifically), and then enter the answer with Selenium again (or your alternative).", "id": "e54qvtj", "replies": []}, {"body": "How is that going to teach you Spanish?", "id": "e54ijel", "replies": [{"body": "Don't get me wrong.
