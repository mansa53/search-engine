I've tried Java, C++, C, HTML, and even Python. Well now that I'm out of school I've finally decided to use all my efforts on learning Python as that's the easiest language I feel. But code has never really caught on with me...should I take notes? Do I have to remember what each individual word/variable means? \n\nEdit: I've actually been taking notes, I just wanted to know if they're actually beneficial. Programming reminds me of math too, and I SUCK at Math. I rarely got 70's in high school. ", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": "Yes and yes. Or know how to find out what they mean", "id": "e5d1gxe", "replies": []}, {"body": "Personally, I like to create \"quick reference\" style of notes that are easily searchable (e.g. functions/syntax that you have seen in a single text document).  If you take extensive notes, I feel like it will become too burdensome to reference on-the-fly.  You really are going to learn through coding projects, so I really don't think it is benefitial to be overly detailed.  You can always reference outside sources with a quick google search if you need detailed information.\n\nI recommend avoiding textbooks at first. Do interactive tutorials such as Codecademy.", "id": "e5d4yst", "replies": []}, {"body": "Yes, you should be taking notes, it will be easier for you to learn. You should focus on a single language at the start rather than trying multiple languages out. < - My opinion, just easier for me.", "id": "e5d4cy5", "replies": []}, {"body": "No! You don't need to know ***every*** word, **BUT** you should know how to do something, for example. You're probably not going to want to be googling how to add stuff to a list, every time you utilize lists. You should have a fair idea of what a lot of the core components of your language are. \n\nYes, you should be taking notes, but I can't stress this enough, you're better writing code. Obviously not from day 1 where you only know how to Install Python and create variable. Practice what you learn, learn it like the back of your hand, and it'll stick in your brain. \n\nI get that it's overwhelming right now, but just keep up the hardwork and you'll eventually realize that it's sticking. \n\nI'd also like to add it's not good to learn a language because it's 'easy', learn it because it's 'useful' or because you love what you can do with it!
