Is there a specific reason the course may be using 6 instead of 10?\n\nI will be using Java with something called [Sysml](https://sysml.org/) which I also don't have any experience with.\n\nAny advice will be greatly appreciated as I am hoping to use this Java course to continue learning it in my free time later on.\n\n", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": "You will still install the newest JDK and the Java6 stuff will work fine. Java 7 mostly brought some syntax sugar (with a couple other things) so it might have been better, but generally 6 is still fine. \n\nJava 8 brings in some pretty different concepts that can be a challenge to really grasp when you\u2019re trying to just teach how to program. \n\nAs for modelling. I have no idea why they still teach modelling as a viable architectural strategy in school. It doesn\u2019t work. It has never worked. It is not going to magically start working. The models can be somewhat nice to have for documentation in very complex systems, but that\u2019s where it ends. While you should still pass this portion because you kind of have to, I wouldn\u2019t focus your studies on it.

I could be wrong, so don\u2019t take that as a fact. \n\nThe problem with the brand of modelling that schools push is that\n\n1) they require specific, planning oriented development methodologies, which is effectively frowned upon these days in most sectors\n\n2)  the idea they push is you should model your application and use a generator to create the stubs, which ends up almost never actually playing out according to plan\n\n3) to do it even somewhat effectively requires a depth of subject matter expertise and experience that few are willing to dedicate the time to. Even if you are a SME, you\u2019re still human and make mistakes.

Twenty years ago the view was quite na\u00efve compared with today, almost blindly focusing on the concept of an \"object\" that was somehow a digital representation of a real object. This is especially noticeable in textbooks of the era.\n\nA modern view of OOP focuses on what that particular language feature offers you and modern languages are no longer \"pure OOP\" but a mix of that with other features (FP for example).\n\nTherefore I do see issues with a course being taught from 10-year-old material. Both the material and the teachers are likely to be frozen in time and will tell you their little stories. You'll still learn something from them, but won't be as informed as you could be with a more modern approach.\n\nUnfortunately, as a veteran who ended his career at the university more than a decade ago, I kind of lost contact with what is considered good teaching material today, so I can't offer a suggestion. If you're a motivated student, I would indeed recommend you find some more up-to-date material.
