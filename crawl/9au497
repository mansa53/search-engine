Is this at all common practice for developers? Especially solo/self-taught developers?\n\nI'm still learning, and the small scripts I've built aren't at all professional, but I figure I should get a github account going and use whatever name I'd want to use in the future.\n\nAm I thinking about this right? \n\nThanks!
