{"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9b16yg/tip_for_someone_about_to_graduate_in_a_year/", "text": "So I'm about to graduate with a [BSIT ](https://www.ecu.edu/degrees/BS/Industrial%20Technology/)degree. While my stuff focuses heavily on networking and cyber security. I really wanted to be a coder from the start. I enjoy it more, and I honestly believe it's a better career path. I have made some Android/iOS apps, python scripts, websites, and minor things like that. But I haven't messed around with it for a good year due to the difficulty of the last few semesters (project management classes) and lack of push. Because I have about a year (end of summer 2019) to go. I'm wondering a few things.\n\n\u200b\n\n* What type of coding projects should I think about doing? *(This is one of the hardest things for me to figure out since I don't run across too many problems that can be solved with coding. That or it is something crazy like somehow using AR to see where water pipes are under ground (something I tried doing but found to be way way way over my head).)*\n* Which coding languages should I focus on?  *(I have experience with Java (which I know a bit more than the others due to Android), Objective C, C#, Python, and HTML. There could be a few others, but they aren't coming to mind. I don't have strong feelings at all between them.)*\n* What online sites should I use to help me out? *(I've tried Treehouse in the past, but the content there seems to be lacking. And I haven't heard in a really long time of anyone getting a job from that alone. I've tried free code camp, but the material is super super dry. (I am going to try to pick up from what I last was on free coding camp))*\n* Do you think certs will help me at all?\n\nIt should be noted my overall hope is to get a fully remote position if all possible. I live on a farm, and I would like to keep doing that as a side thing. When I was a bit more active in coding a few years back I gotten offers to places like Hong Kong, but again I have no desire to move. I think at worst I hope to be able to pick up a job in the  Raleigh  NC area or  Wilmington NC area. BTW this is my LinkedIn [https://www.linkedin.com/in/craigbennettii/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/craigbennettii/) I'm going to be working on a real portfolio later. [I'm going to be using this video to help me out on that. Any tips here will be welcomed.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eps1paAaLC8) Oh and if anyone is wondering why I'm getting a degree more in line with networking than coding. All the coding degrees in the local universities required me to physically be there, and I couldn't afford that. On top of that, this degree is a 2x2 from my previous degree. The benefit to it is I understand cyber security  to a point and network engineering.", "score": 54, "comments": [{"body": "I don't have a degree and just recently got a SEng job, so it may be even easier for you. \n\nCoding language doesn't matter. Seriously. What matters is your ability to pick up new technologies quickly. I really only know Javascript. I've worked with Python, Java, and C in the past, but not nearly as much as with JS. The job uses GoLang. I assured them in the interview that I am a quick learner. And over the two days, I completed the take-home test in this language I'd never touched. Learn the fundamentals.\n\nGoogle 'app ideas' for ideas. Simple as that. You got tons of time. Create as many full-stack apps as possible, and make sure you do everything from prototyping/wireframing to deployment. Learn the necessary tools like Git for version control, AWS for various cloud services, and Debugger among others. Think of yourself as a one-man tech company. \n\nDon't learn one thing at a time. Just create projects, and learn everything on a need-to-learn basis. One thing at a time can be a massive time sink. Personal experience, anyway. You can go back and learn in detail after you complete the project.\n\nFor every project, create a detailed README. This seriously impressed my interviewers. They never told me to do it, nor was it expected. In the readme, talk about your prototyping proxess, give brief explanation on why you used the techs that you used, and problems you faced during and their resolutions. Your code itself should also have documentation, and generally be \"good\" code. But don't agonize over them. You can do most of these after you've completed coding. \n\nCerts can help. Tells employers that you take initiative outside of school too, and passion is one of the biggest thing they look for.

Focus on doing these in their online editor, which is a kind of middle ground between whiteboard coding and an IDE.\n\nYou can do it in Java or whatever other language they offer and you want to learn, and I think it can really help you get used to programming in a general sense.\n\n\\---\n\nRegarding coding projects...you say you haven't been able to come up with a problem that can be solved with coding, but this likely has to do with your lack of experience in programming. The more you learn about *what* you can do, the more your mind will suggest programming as a solution to problems. I would suggest finding a project online somewhere that you can recreate from scratch, instead of trying to make your own. Just for now, so you'll have something to show off on your Github.\n\n\\---\n\nRegarding languages, look at remote jobs that fit your criteria, and look at what skills they want you to have. Find out what's most common for your ideal job. Then target those.\n\n\\---\n\nCerts...maybe, mostly if you want a structured learning process. I find certifications to look nice on a resume, but they honestly don't sway me very much either way.\n\n\\---\n\nDon't sweat the degree too much. Just learn, practice, and build up a portfolio. It will take you a while to find the job you want, but that will always be true for anyone job-hunting.

From here you can go the front-end route or the back-end route, and it seems you are better suited for doing back-end stuff. \n\nAnd you said you are more familiar with Java, maybe try getting into Spring?\n\nAlso here is a helpful resource to help you get started on this road if you so choose to: https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap#-back-end-roadmap", "id": "e4zults", "replies": [{"body": "> So I think the best chance you have at getting a remote position is in web development.\n\nThanks I will take a look at that link. Also, I never heard of Spring. I will take a look at that too.\n\nAs far as front end vs back end. I've never had strong feelings about 1 vs the other. Even more since everything I done so far I worked by myself. So I had to do both. The only good thing with this is I kinda can say I can do some full stack development. \n\n\nAnyways, again thanks for the info.", "id": "e4zvuh2", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Have you checked /r/cscareerquestions ?

The cybersecurity that was trying on isn't looking at code. It's more knowing a network, looking at traffic, social engineering, and also physical security. There was a heavy amount of red team stuff in my training. There is some on how to write signatures for viruses so an anti-virus can find it in the future. I've never done bug bounties before.
