I was having aspect ratio issues so a few sites recommended making image views and simply put transparent buttons on top of them. I've placed six image views in a stack view and constrained it to the bottom. I thought it would make sense to put six buttons in another stack view and then also constrain it to the bottom, but it always constrains to the nearest neighbor so now the images are actually on the bottom of the screen, but the transparent buttons are vertically sitting above them. Is it possible to have both constrained to the bottom of the screen so that they completely overlap? Thanks!
