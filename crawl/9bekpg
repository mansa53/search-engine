In comparison, a language like C++ will look familiar at first but it's actually quite a bit more complicated and different.\n\nJava is used more for web back-ends, and for native Android apps. It used to be popular for desktop apps, but it's not recommended for that anymore. It's also used for hundreds of other things.\n\nC# is the most popular language for Windows desktop apps, and it's quite popular for games, and it's also used for Xamarin, a cross-platform app framework.\n\nOther than that, they're pretty much both equally powerful and both pretty popular.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "e52fyr0", "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the info.

C# is known to be prevalent in game development, however it is also commonly used in engineering companies.  Typically, C# would be used with Qt to make GUIs for interacting with the devices used/developed.  The reason is that C# can interact with lower-level C/C++ drivers, which would be a nightmare (if even possible) in Java.  On the flipside, Java is used extensively in mobile/networking applications.  Personally, I would go with the C# route, as it will likely be easier to go C# -> Java than the inverse.  I predict that C# will grow in the upcoming years, while Java will start to fade away.  Both are valid choices though, as long as you understand the fundamentals of programming.  Most of your \"learning\" will come from on the job anyways.
