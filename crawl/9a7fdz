It feels like I might get better results if I knew a specific name for it if there\u2019s one, of course.\n\n**The data structure**\n\nIt\u2019s a tree. Each node can have an an arbitrary number of attributes (or just an arbitrary data blob associated). Each node can have an arbitrary number of children. Siblings are arbitrarily ordered (i.e. an array, not a set).\n\nExample implementation: HTML DOM.\n\n**Algorithms**\n\nI\u2019m specifically interested in transformation/mapping algorithms: how to build another (different, transformed according to certain rules) tree when I have one.\n\nThe internet is full of all sorts of special trees (b-trees, red-black trees, suffix trees, etc) but more generic variants mysteriously avoid my google-fu. \n\nPlease help me find it. All links, however little relevant, are welcome\n\nThank you in advance.", "score": 4, "comments": [{"body": "Since you haven't put any constraints on the structure it's just a generic tree.
