Here as some questions I would like to ask about coding since I have no idea where to star.\n\n1. What programming language is easy to learn, yet can do some decent tasks? I have alot of time yet I do want to know a good programming language.\n\n2. What Free or Cheap programs can I use to start programming, cause right now all I have is notepad and a windows 10 pc.\n\n3. How do I find tutorials or help since I will need alot of it to learn the basics.\n\n4. What will be the easiest and hardest thing to learn.\n\n5. Does it reqire alot of time in one run, I have alot of time in little pockets, yet going all in for 3 hours will not work that well\n\nThank you and hope to be coding/programming with you soon!", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "Pick what you want to do and go for a language good at that.  The previous reply said JavaScript HTML and CSS which is mostly web dev front end stuff.  C or C++ would be kernel/embedded/etc stuff generally.  Python, java, etc are pretty good back end languages for your front end stuff to interact with.  perl and shell scripting are useful if you want to go the sysadmin route.  Most (other than the web dev stuff) can do more than just those areas but generally that's where they seem to be strong.", "id": "e4skd4p", "replies": []}, {"body": "Well. If you really need money asap then learn html css basic js and php THEN wordpress and maybe basic SQL.\n\nThat will help you get a job as a freelancer.\n\nBut to be fair wordpress is all about gluing stuff together to make it work. Its not a real skill as you're considered as an advanced user not a developer BUT you can make some money on your way to learn more about php or whatever backend you would like.", "id": "e4soxo8", "replies": []}, {"body": "Use the search feature", "id": "e4sxpfa", "replies": []}], "title": "Broke and Want to Learn Coding"}
