Now let me say what my problem actually is:  \n\n\nSo, I want to build a website that can do a very simple thing:  \nthe user will insert a ID (a unique number, to be clear)  \nthe site shall then return a document previously made, it should be a picture of a certificate at first but it could also be a pdf.  \n\n\nSo, that is the very basics and I have searched on the internet on how to do it and, since I know nothing about html it has been quit hard to find things or even examples that are more direct.  \nIt really doesn't have to be a website, a spreadsheet (like a google sheet) that can do just that and be relatively safe, that is, it wont show all results to the user, for example, is fine.  \n\n\nSo, if you have any ideas of an easy and relatively safe way to do it, please let me know. I will be really glad for any link, tutorial or material that can help.  \n\n\nThank you!  \n", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Google Sheets could definitely work. You could drop all of the files (image / pdf files of certificates) into a folder, use a script like [this one](http://www.acrosswalls.org/ortext-datalinks/list-google-drive-folder-file-names-urls/) to generate a sheets file, and use some kind of VLOOKUP formula so that whoever is referencing your doc can input + retrieve a link to the document.\n\nIdeally, the filenames for all of your files are consistent so you can use a single formula to get the actual identifier itself for the lookup column.", "id": "e547xg6", "replies": []}], "title": "Website for documents"}
