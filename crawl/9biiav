I know it looks a bit too big for what it does, but I wanted it to be able to handle punctuation, integers, and letters. Anyway, [here](https://gist.github.com/ZlPMusic/7d05bdee3f441154b0bcf63682ed990a) is the code. I haven't tested it that much, so there are probably going to be some errors. If you encounter one, let me know what you inputted and give me the full error message. If you have any suggestions for making the code better or any questions, let me know. Feedback is always appreciated.\n\nP.S.
