I only know well one language so far, which is C. I have some general knowledge of HTML and CSS, but my web experience is almost non-existent.\n\nI'm going to start an internship in a startup in a few days, and my goal will be to develop a cross-platform mobile app. So no pure Java/Kotlin or Swift. I'm stressing the fact that the company is a startup, meaning they have no other mobile developers, and I will have to learn on my own, won't be able to ask someone for tips or help. The app won't be a game, it will be something that allows users to take online classes and communicate in groups. Think something like discord.\n\nI've been looking into numerous frameworks, and I've been trying to learn NativeScript (and Javascript as well, for obvious reasons) for a month now. Javascript is going well, I've almost completed the freecodecamp JS certification. However Nativescript is an absolute nightmare. There are very few tutorials (the main one is using Angular and Typescript), a small community and few resources out there. The company that employs me insisted that I should use Nativescript because they are using VueJS for their website or something and I'll be able to reuse the views for the app.\n\n\u200b\n\nMy problems are the following:\n\n1/ NativeScript is a pain to learn. Tutorials and courses are almost non-existent, while something like ReactNative is much more used and have a richer ecosystem.\n\n2/ I want to use that internship opportunity to learn a framework that has a good market value. Angular seems inferior in that aspect.\n\n3/ I'm freaking the fuck out because I've been trying to learn NativeScript for a month and I'm getting nowhere. I feel like I will be unable to complete the app in the 6 months internship period.\n\n\u200b\n\nShould I try to convince my employers to use a different framework such as Xamarin, Cordova, ReactNative or whatever else? Can anybody recommend me some solid tutorials to get me started on building a cross-platform mobile app? Should I just throw myself out of the window?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: thanks everyone for the replies! I should clarify a few points: I am getting paid (a bit above minimum wage), will be working 2-3 days per week top (most of them remote) as my employer understands that I also need time to work on my school projects. This makes it a great opportunity for me. Even though I will be working on my own on the app for now the other devs are working on NodeJS and some frontend frameworks and will teach me about them (doesn't help with my current mission, but will be good experience to add). Also, I've started picking up ReactNative and will try to talk about this option with the CTO.", "score": 76, "comments": [{"body": "An internship in this industry should include mentoring.
