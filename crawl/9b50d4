[Here](https://gist.github.com/Integralist/7944948) is a gist summarizing what she was saying and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URSWYvyc42M) is the full talk.\n\nLet's say I have some object `A` that I want to test and `A` is on the client-side of my web application. It takes to some API and I want to make sure it is requesting data from the right portion of the API (e.g. a `PATCH` to `/some/url` with some `body` payload.)\n\nThat seems to me like part of the contract of the object? Am I testing my code the correct way? Am I misinterpreting the point Sandi was trying to get across? I really am focusing on _not_ writing brittle tests but that still test what need to be tested.", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "I suppose the simplest answer is if you wrote it you should test it.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt really doesn't matter what the code is doing, you wrote it so the only way to make sure that it works to your standards is to test it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever if you are using someone else's code (like an API) and you don't know whether they have fully tested their code it might also make you feel better to write tests for their code as well, at least the parts that you depend upon, so you have confidence that their code performs to your standard.  You might find inconsistencies that they have missed and be able to improve their code.", "id": "e50fumw", "replies": []}], "title": "Should outgoing messages from object under test be tested?"}
