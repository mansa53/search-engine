After spending all summer familiarizing myself with programming as much as I can and  with zero knowledge prior I still am absolutely novice, but am happy to state that I have gone back to school for a degree in Computer Science and look forward to earning my degree. It goes without saying that I am thankful for this sub and am sure that I will be relying on the aid of you all heavily in the near future. Nonetheless, I never would have taken the leap without such a great community filled with support for us late bloomers who are just now discovering their interest and convincing themselves that they can do it!", "score": 181, "comments": [{"body": "Really happy to hear this.

Practice programming every day.\n\n I obtained my bachelor's in C.S this last May, and clearly didn't put in enough effort on my own educational advancement. I went to class, did homework and projects, etc. However, I never practiced or exposed myself to new things on my own time. I blame my incapability to shed my hedonistic lifestyle, resulting in far too much consumption of pot and booze and hanging out in others' rooms.\n\nFinding a job is super difficult for me now, as I'm straight up dumb.

This is purely subjective based on what I\u2019ve seen around me lately:\n- Learn multiple languages, don\u2019t be a \u201cjava developer\u201d. It\u2019s good to have a language preference but what you want is to learn how to learn a new language in no time.\n- Talk to your teachers and do side projects as much as you can. This is where you\u2019ll learn the most. You\u2019ll get to learn and apply new stuff while getting important experience.\n- Try and really understand the fundamentals. It\u2019s easy to be in the illusion of knowledge.  Even though it won\u2019t be required, I suggest you always try and understand everything that\u2019s going on from a piece of code to the CPU.  Thinking deep will make things harder of course but it\u2019ll help you figure out where you lack knowledge.\n- Have fun. The courses will give you the tools and only that. Kind of like LEGO pieces. Be creative and think big to see what you can do with those pieces.\n- Last but not least: find a good group of friends. Discuss issues together. Try and build things together.
