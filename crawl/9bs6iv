Before this summer tried learning C++, C, C#, Java, Python, HTML and CSS. Every single time I start learning. First 2-3 days I am so enthusiastic, watch 10-15 episodes of tutorials in a day and code until I am so tired. But after a week I don't want to learn and just want to code. I can't code things I want because I did not learn enough. So I stop spending my time doing things about that language and start playing games, watching random youtube videos because I'm bored.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis summer was no exception. I started with Python then Tkinker, HTML and CSS, back to Python, back to HTML and CSS but this time I started also learning JavaScript then I got bored and started learning PHP. I'm now still at PHP but I don't want to watch youtube tutorials because 1- It is teaching me things that I mostly know from other languages 2 - I want to code instead of learning.\n\n\u200b\n\nThat's it I guess. I don't know what to do because I want to improve myself but this is what I face with evertime. Do you have any suggestions?", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "It sounds like you focus too much on video tutorials. While a few of these might be OK for entertainment or providing you a \"oh that's cool maybe I'll check that out\", probably 90% of them are not good for serious learning. \n\nIf you want to learn seriously, first pick a target, then gather some learning materials (e.g. official written tutorials, books, small project ideas, etc.), then form a plan on how to approach learning it. Pick a focus. For example from your picks it sounds like you want to do back end web development. So if that's the case, first you should focus on that. Focus on PHP programming, a bit of HTML, CSS, etc. with that goal in mind. After you have some experience try to do some similar things using Python and see what parts are easier in Python and what parts are still better in PHP. And repeat this while gaining experience.\n", "id": "e55bjxc", "replies": []}, {"body": "Seems like lack of direction and probably burnout to me.\n\nTry spacing your learning out more, make sure it's not the *only* thing you do, and don't exhaust yourself doing it. Pace yourself.\n\nAlso, try learning with some sort of focus or objective, be it finishing a course, or a project, or something else. Some sort of tangible end goal that is realistic and motivating. Don't set out to become an expert in everything, that's never going to end well, break it down into steps.\n\n> 2 - I want to code instead of learning.\n\nWhy not both? The act of coding itself is a learning process in my (limited) experience.  \nI'm terrible at coming up with projects but if you have something in mind that's probably a good way to go.", "id": "e55bye8", "replies": []}, {"body": "Your time probably isn't wasted.

You're tiring yourself out too much. Take it easy! Little bit at a time. Your brain is really good at processing & absorbing knowledge in the background. So work for 2-3 hours, then rest until the following day. ", "id": "e55cc1t", "replies": []}, {"body": "You're burning yourself out.\nTry working at something for a few hours a day over longer times. You will retain the information better this way, and it won't become boring so easily.\n\nVideotutorials help, but they're no substitution for actually coding.\n\nLogic in programming rarely changes. Once you have python down, you can solve the same problems in PHP but with different syntax. It seems you know some problem solving already. \n\nI'd recommend thinking of what you would like to make, or what you would like to learn, and pick and stick to a language based off that.(website/game/etc). If you have something you would like to create, you can start searching for solutions based on what you need, rather than learning random stuff that is explained on videos. Also seeing progress in the form of something you create can be satisfying and motivating.\n\nLast but not least, don't get discouraged :). Programming is not easy, and everyone has his/her own tempo. It's great that you want to learn, and if you write better code than a month that ago, you're making progress!\n\n", "id": "e55crhz", "replies": []}, {"body": "If it makes you feel any better let me give you my 2 cents.\nI am going to graduate with a business degree in December, having learned nothing in school for the last 4 years.\nHowever, I had been on the same path you're in. I was doing the same thing as you, moving here and there.\nI'm 22 now and a little push is all I need to land a job.\nBut here is where things things get interesting the fact that I was learning all of these things actually gave me the knowledge pursue a different career, a career as a tech writer, which is a very rare find in Pakistan.\nThat was very advantageous of for me so even if I don't have the skills to become a real programmer I think I am pretty close. I still have the the knowledge of the programming letting CSS and HTML so I'm getting  ahead and as a writer and hopefully if I become an programmer I will pursue of career in Technical writing so it's not a total loss .\n Whatever you were learning it's going to help you in the future and you're still young and \n you can do whatever you want to do now.

Skipping school is a bad idea.\n\nThe other option is to make lots of things, now, real things that people use... learn apps, learn web applications. That's not tutorials or learning though. You could find a job at a webdev company or just shadow them and see what it's like. And look at tons of code. There's a guy on Quora who is making 250k at 22 and didn't graduate high school... what he did, was he got so good he completely cloned Quora, Reddit, etc., and he says that cloning sites is the best way.
