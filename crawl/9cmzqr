Some people say work on wordpress and others say it must be functioning site that is used to be taken seriously. So to start a career in this what are your ideas for a first timers portfolio, examples would be great too.", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": "Depends really. Are you looking for a career as a web designer, front end developer, full stack?  Is your goal freelance, a startup, a big company?\n\nWordpress can be easy to get into, but to do anything meaningful you are going to need some php knowledge. Php isn\u2019t hard to get into, but Wordpress is usually used more in a freelance/startup webshop kind of environment. \n\nBigger companies are using single page applications in a lot of scenarios which means angular/react. You would want to brush up on your JavaScript to really start diving into those. \n\nWhatever your end goal is, start by making a home page for yourself in html/css and then try to incorporate some simple JavaScript into it.  You can use this to showcase your projects you will be creating in the future. \n\nOnce you have this, start creating some projects that you can build for someone else. Either do a few sites for family/friends or even some non profit work. \n\nIf you want some more JavaScript practice, try making simple browser games from tutorials, then mix it up by changing things about them if you want to experiment . Put those on your site and showcase them. \n\nThe most important advice is build, build, build. The more practice the better. It\u2019s very competitive starting out in this field, but just by creating lots of work, you are putting in more effort than a lot of people. \n\nDon\u2019t worry too much about what technology you are using right now to setup your personal website. These things will get rebuilt by you many times over as you progress further in knowledge.
