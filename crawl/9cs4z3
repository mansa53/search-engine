Here is the example code\n\n    string fullString = \"full string\"; \n    string partOfString = fullString.Substring(5); \n    string shorterPart = fullString.Substring(5, 3); \n    Console.WriteLine(partOfString); \n    Console.WriteLine(shorterPart);\n    \n    //So the console is spitting out\n    String\n    Str\n    //When this code is ran, can somebody please explain why? I understand it's 5 letters and 3 letters as indicated by the 5 and 3 variables right? But why only the word string? Why not the sub part of our string which would come out to // \n    \n    Substr\n    Sub\n\nTL;DR Wondering if I'm taking the right steps and I have a question about coding subStrings\n\n    ", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "`string partOfString = fullString.Substring(5); `\n\nThis means \"skip 5 letters and take the rest\"\n\n`string shorterPart = fullString.Substring(5, 3); `\n\n\"Skip 5 letters and take the next 3\"", "id": "e5d05dd", "replies": [{"body": " Ahhhhhh beause \"full \" is the first 5 characters.

Normally I'd prefer Microsoft's documentation, because it *is* their language, but the first hit I got took me [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-substring-method/) which gives you all the details.\n\nIt's bad that LearnCS.org doesn't tell you these things, although perhaps they are expecting you to look it up or work it out by yourself. This seems a little bit like teaching a spoken language by giving you examples, but no grammar.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "e5d0b47", "replies": [{"body": "I know what it does, I was skipping over something.

You've assigned the string \"full string\" to a variable called fullString, and then called fullString's  Substring method is called with 5 passed in as a value. As another poster mentioned, this means to skip the first 5 places in the string that your variable named FullString is referring to, which in this case has the value of \"full string\". So yes \"full \" is skipped and you're left with just string. \n\nIt looks to me like you were confusing the method call Substring with the actual string itself (\"full string\") that you were using to get the substring. \n\nIn the second case you're again called the Substring method but this time passing in two parameters, the first is again where to start, the second is how many characters to take.\n\nThe main takeaway is that the method call isn't in any way part of the string itself.", "id": "e5d3zxy", "replies": []}], "title": "Question on Substrings and general advice"}
