For instance, I have one particular class which contains an array of instances of another class. I am unsure how to even implement the array(a blob?), much less how to implement an array of classes. Should I restructure my code entirely, use another library, or is there a way to implement what I've described using only Sqlite?", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "You might want to look at ORM frameworks (a popular one for Java is Hibernate). These generally let you store/retrieve data from a database using an object oriented model. They handle the mapping of objects and members to databases, letting you focus on the objects themselves.\n\nSometimes they can be more trouble than they are worth and plenty of people prefer to roll their own, but they do exist and you can use them.\n\nEach class is likely going to be its own table, with one column for each member and almost certainly an `id` column as the key. Members that are arrays will almost always have their own table (with each entry in the array being a row), with a foreign key that points back to the parent.", "id": "e4ui6yn", "replies": []}, {"body": "Look up one-to-many relationships.", "id": "e4ui1bx", "replies": []}, {"body": "You can store an array of objects in noSQL databases", "id": "e4ui1eu", "replies": []}, {"body": "There is a concept in SQL called a foreign key, where one column in a table will be the key of another table used to keep track of references between the two.\n\nIf each element of the array can only be held by one of the parent classes then you may want a setup like the second class\u2019s table having a reference to the first parent class table.
