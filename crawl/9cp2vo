So far I have learned Java and C# and a bit of Python and C++. In the last days I watched a loot of  the \"How to choose your first programm language\" videos. But these Videos didnt help me, because I already know most of the core concepts (if, while, for, variables, functions, etc). Also I dont really like the style of python and I dont like Python that much. I would like to to some Desktop Apps, and maybe some Serever stuff. The only things I dont like are low level programming and Webdesign (Im also not a fan of js).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt would be super helpfull, to get some suggestions and ideas what I shoul learn, instead of the normal \"It depends\".\n\nThanks", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "You aren\u2019t going to get anywhere if you only ever learn the basics of a language then move onto the next one.

The hard part of learning to code isn't learning new programming languages -- the hard part is using what you know to build complex things.\n\nRather then learning a new language, I recommend practicing using the ones you already know. Pick one of the languages (any one) and use it to build something. It could be a totally new creation, or a clone of an existing program. (For example, I personally got started with programming by making clones of different video games -- things like pong, minesweeper, basic platformers...)\n\nThe [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_where_can_i_find_practice_exercises_and_project_ideas.3F) has some links for different project ideas.", "id": "e5c8o4a", "replies": []}, {"body": "Don't learn new languages.
