And as of right now it produces this.\n\n    <select name=\"Answers[1].AnswerText\" class=\"form-control valid\" id=\"Answers_1__AnswerText\" aria-invalid=\"false\">\n\nAnd we already used that name and ID in several places in AJAX so we would prefer not to change asp-for.\n\nWhat I discovered though is now that I want to edit it wants me to put the variable for the value its going to be in asp-for; in my case \"answerTextForQuestion\". I put that in for asp-for and click edit and when the page loads it does indeed pre-populate that dropdown but then it breaks all the AJAX functionality because the edit changed that variable changes as it goes through a switch statement but now all of my dropdowns all have the id = answerTextForQuestion... which is bad.\n\nWhat I need is just the ability to tell the select statement that the preselected value is answerTextForQuestion, but without changing the ID or name (so not use asp-for).", "score": 1, "comments": [], "title": "trying to prepopulate a select input using .NET Core ASP Pages"}
