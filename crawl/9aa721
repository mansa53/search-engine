I particularly need to use the location data that mobile phones provide via their GPS chip. Unfortunately I don't have the skills to make an Android or iOS app. I can only really build websites using Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I'd like to be able to make my website look as close as possible to a native app as possible but I'm not sure what changes I would need to make to my website in order to make that happen.\n\nAre there any things I need to bear in mind when making when my website if I eventually want to make it work as close to a native mobile app as possible?", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Accessing the GPS coordinates doesn't require the website to be an app:\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API\n\nFor the app to look as close as possible to a native app ... well, that's possible with just CSS.\n\nDon't overcomplicate things.
