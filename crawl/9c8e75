To name a few:\n\n\\- [Enlight Quickshot](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/enlight-quickshot/id1254875992?mt=8)\n\n\\- [Manly](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/manly-body-muscle-editor-pro/id1263326810?mt=8)\n\n\\- [FaceApp](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/faceapp-neural-face-magic/id1180884341?mt=8)\n\n\u200b\n\nAnd there are many more. What I'm really wondering about is what kind of machine learning (if any?) techniques these apps use to generate a realistic looking output for each different picture. Because I have to admit after trying some, the results are quite impressive.\n\nDo they use machine learning (or some other AI technique) at all, or am I totally missing the point?\n\n\u200b\n\nAll the best,\n\nMr. Shrimps", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "I am a complete noob so take this with a grain of salt but I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any machine learning with these apps. \n\nI think it\u2019s simply semi-complex algorithms which manipulate the images based on set parameters.
