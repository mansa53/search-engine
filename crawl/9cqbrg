No one else at my school knows much about code, so I think most of the people who will go will be brand new to programming. I've worked out a plan to teach them about coding, but we meet an hour every week on Mondays. That's not a lot of time, and I think by the end of the school year they'll come out with basic understanding of coding. What are some good beginner projects that will make them feel like they accomplished something. I want something like tic-tac-toe that requires absolutely 0 apis/libraries. Preferably something that doesn't run in the console.
