", "score": 3, "comments": [{"body": "Since this is your first programming language, I would highly recommend sticking to Python for now.  Python is a very good language to explain programming basics, and what you learn in Python can most likely be applied to other languages you will learn in the future.\n\nAlso, I would really not recommend suddenly jumping ship and starting C++ when you don't have a good grasp on Python, or at least another language.  C++ is a hard language to learn, and while you *could* make it your first language, I don't totally recommend it unless you're only interested in using it.  IMO C++ and some concepts that bewilder newcomers are much easier to understand if you have the basics down pat.\n\nYou can also do a lot with just Python.  Trying to learn multiple programming languages at once *is* doable, but I do not recommend it when you're just starting out.\n\nBasically, I'm just saying to stick with Python for now, see how you like programming, and absorb as much as you can before trying to commit to other languages.", "id": "e54yywh", "replies": []}, {"body": "Hi, I'm a recent beginner like you who just started a formal CS program at a university. Incidentally, when I was initially self-teaching, I studied a few chapters of a Python book I purchased. I then switched to learning C++ because my university program uses it for nearly all their courses.\n\nI believe Python is a really good place to start because from a top-down perspective, the language takes care of a lot of details you would normally have to specify in C++ to make even the simplest of programming statements work. \n\nBy not having to spend so much brainpower just on the syntax and formatting of a language, you get to focus more on the concept of programming as a whole, i.e. planning out how to solve problems.\n\nOnce you've got the basics down (and a bit more) of programming via Python, then it'll be way easier to grasp other languages, since the concepts are the same, just with changes here and there in the format of things in the next language you choose.", "id": "e5533d0", "replies": []}, {"body": "When you need to, I suggest starting a project and learning along the way rather than trying to learn with no context.", "id": "e55vc2q", "replies": []}], "title": "CS student learning Python on Udemy.
