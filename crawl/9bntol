They look similar at first glance, but that's because they both have syntax based on C. They share little beyond that and have *very* different ways of doing things. \n\nI know this doesn't actually answer your question, but I thought it's best to make sure you're aware. Java is still definitely worth knowing, I much prefer it to javascript and there's a lot of jobs that will use both (or just Java) so don't ignore Java just based on this comment.
