If you wanted to make this perfect in my eyes, you would allow the system to dynamically grab the current time, convert that into minutes, subtract that from the amount of--well you get the idea. Basically, have the program be dynamic instead of used fixed values for the time. I know that's pretty easy to do in C# with the DateTime class, but C++ could be different.
