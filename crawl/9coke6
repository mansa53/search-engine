Don\u2019t try too hard to \u201cremember\u201d.\nStats show that when you try too hard to remember that you don\u2019t remember.\n\nIf you can do multiple choice test or flash cards before you start studying the material you will remember better when you come across it later whilst studying.\n\nExplain to someone what you have studied. If you don\u2019t have anyone, tell the person in the mirror.\n\nLast tip is to change your study environment. Change rooms or even places. Even if you change the background music it still counts as a change. Brain relates different things you learn to the smells, noise, etc. to where you were at that time.  Best to read on this in the book to understand. \n\nOh and the other thing that\u2019s is very strange is that distractions are good for the memory. If someone barges in on you and asks you a random question in the middle of your studies. Don\u2019t get angry. Your brain gets distracted for a moment and it needs to work harder to try and remember where it was. Therefore you remember it better in the future.\nSo if your phone distracts you for 5 minutes of if you go to the loo it\u2019s no big drama ;-)", "id": "e5c79kw", "replies": []}, {"body": "Repetition.  \n\nRead the chapter before lecture - 1 exposure.    \nGo to the lecture and take notes - 2nd exposure.  \nRewrite notes the day of class - 3rd exposure.  \nDo homework and talk to other students - 4th exposure.  \nReview notes - 5th exposure.\n\nAlso you can substitute in \"Reread chapter\" for some of these.\n\nSo by the time the test rolls around, you also usually have a study guide already built, you know your weak areas and can focus on them.\n\nIt's hard to fit this all in sometimes but the more you can expose yourself to the material the better.
