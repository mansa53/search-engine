Relevant lines of code are as follows:\n\n=IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH(Sheet4!$A$7,C2)), MAX($B$1:B1)+1, 0)\n\n=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(ROWS($E$2:E2),B2:C301, 2,0), \"\")\n\n=COUNTIF(E2:E301,\"?\\*\")\n\nName Manager =OFFSET(Sheet3!$E$2,,,COUNTIF(Sheet3!$E$2:$E$303,\"?\\*\"))\n\nThen use data validation to make a drop down list from the name manager. However, I need to do this for 170 cells, and I was wondering if there was a workaround rather than copying and pasting 170 times. I need to change the reference cell each time, as well as the lookups and offsets. \n\nAlso 110% open to redoing it an easier way if you know a better way!
