I believe Java encourages you to name interfaces what the object under contract is. So it would be a property.\n\nAlso, I think your DateTime object might interfere with the built-in DateTime classes, it perhaps need a more context relative name like RentalDates.\n\nLooking good! I'll keep reading and leave more info as I see it.", "id": "e4v1fu5", "replies": []}]}]}], "title": "Need some help/feedback on my Class Diagram"}
