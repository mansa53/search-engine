Type `Animal` doesn't define the method `bark`. There could be another subclass of `Animal` called `Cat` that doesn't implement `bark` at all. If you could call `dog.bark()` with `dog` being of type `Animal` then you could also call `cat.bark()` with `cat` being declared as of type `Animal` which would result in undefined behavior, most probably a program crash.", "id": "e4uoh4c", "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for the detailed explanation!", "id": "e4utkwl", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "As mentioned you declared the dog variable as type of Animal. Because animal doesn\u2019t have a bark method it wont\u2019 work.
