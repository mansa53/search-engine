{"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9cppni/i_study_4_hours_a_day_what_should_i_do_in_the/", "text": "I usually wake up in the morning, I go to the gym, eat something, I take a shower and start to study, but I'm not studying more than 4 hours a day because I hardly remember things, and I do not want to overwhelm my brain studying all day . But the rest of my day I have absolutely nothing to do, of course, I do things at home, prepare food, wash clothes a few times a week...\n\n\u200b\n\nWhat do you guys think is cool to do in that time? Should I practice on my own what I studied in those 4 hours? Can I read any book about programming and / or computing? (like a book that has no codes to learn, such as \"How Software Works\" and \"The Clean Coder\").\n\n\u200b\n\nI accept any tip, just do not want to spend half of my day doing nothing useful. I already tried to study between 6 to 8 hours a day, but my head seemed to go somewhere else and I could not reason very well. So if I increase my study schedule, it will be for a maximum of 5 hours in a row.\n\n\u200b\n\nps: I'm currently studying Django from official tutorial. I know a little Python, HTML, CSS, SQL and some very basic things about JavaScript, Client-Server and UDP.\n\nI've studied HTML / CSS just to get a sense of the front end and get to create some CSS-only web pages. My goal is back end, I can not go out creating projects because I'm still learning backend, I intend to complete the django tutorial and then read \"django 2 by example\", after that I think I'll have a good base to create more projects complexes alone using just the doc to help.\n\nMy study is always just to read and follow the program created by the book/tutorial. But I intend to practice creating a little different projects using the knowledge I learned from Turtoris/books.\n\n\u200b", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": "By study do you mean just read? If so you need to be writing programs. Reading is not sufficient by a long shot to learn how to program and if you\u2019re only reading you are very likely to find that you\u2019ve learned very little. Writing programs is the best teacher.", "id": "e5cel77", "replies": []}, {"body": "I'm a bit curious: what do you do when you study?  At the end of your post it sounds like you are following a tutorial.  Is that how you spend all of your study time?\n\nI have three recommendations:\n\n1. If you're going to work for four hours in a day, I find that four 1-hour chunks are more productive that one 4-hour block.  It gives my brain some time to relax and absorb the things that I've learned.  In the breaks between the hours, stretch a bit, get some food and water, watch some tv, or whatever.  You might also find that splitting your time over different tasks is more useful then doing one thing for the entire day.\n2. If you already know some basics about programming, I suggest finding a project that interests you and trying to complete it.  Is there a simple program that you would like to write or some task you'd like to automate?  If so, try to figure out how to make it happen.  If you can't think of anything, then there are lots of websites out there with project ideas for inspiration.  ([You can start by checking out the FAQ for this sub; there's good stuff in there.](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq))  I find that I learn MUCH better if I'm actually working on real code than if I'm reading a textbook, watching a video, or the like.\n3. Based on your post, it sounds like your goal is web design?  Once you have one or two simple projects under your belt, every time you learn a new skill I suggest trying to find a way to apply it in one of your projects.  Even if it's a really simple implementation, I think you'll find that you learn better when you're using the skills that you're developing instead of trying to remember them.\n\nEveryone is different, but that's my advice.  Good luck!  :-)", "id": "e5ceuk2", "replies": []}, {"body": "Are you actually coding during these hours or mainly reading/watching videos about it? You should be coding. Also, I would be careful studying for so long *every* day. It's a great way to burn yourself out. \n\nIn my opinion, after a successful day of coding, you should reward yourself in whatever is fun for you.
