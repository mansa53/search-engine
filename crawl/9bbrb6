I'm just looking for a high-level understanding. And what are the pros/cons of choosing one over the other? \n\nI was asked the pros and cons of choosing one scheme over the other during an interview. I mentioned case sensitivity as the main benefit for having the username in the path. The interviewer agreed but I feel that there are more reasons.

It's pretty clear that a username after the domain means that it's still the same website. But when you start messing with the beginning part of the domain name then it's very easy to open the door to tricking people into phishing links. At a quick glance `www.username.domain.com` looks pretty similar to `www.username-domain.com`, especially to a non technical person.\n* Another thing to note is regarding cookies. Cookies that are set on a sub domain are not available on other sub domains. So it might be a bit more complicated on the cookie front.", "id": "e520gur", "replies": []}, {"body": "Here's a real-life use case from a major website - deviantART recently changed their user profile scheme from subdomains to paths. [Here's the announcement post](https://www.deviantart.com/danlev/journal/New-Profile-URLs-751783111), but the main two reasons given were:\n\n> **Why Changing URLs Is for the Better**\n\n> * **The new URLs will likely increase your traffic**: Based on Search Engine Optimization (SEO) experts we\u2019ve consulted with and also other sites that have made the switch, moving away from subdomains is likely to increase overall site traffic from search engines\u2014this means more traffic to your Profiles and deviations.\n\n> * **Subdomains cause many technical challenges**, inhibiting site improvement and performance. Browsers treat subdomains like different, individual sites for security reasons and, because of this, more and more website functionality is being limited to working with a single domain. Working around these restrictions makes building new features and maintaining old ones complicated, increasing the time it takes our engineers to complete projects. It also creates \u201cbuggy\u201d circumstances while navigating the site. For example, you might have noticed that it sometimes shows the wrong artist\u2019s name in the URL when using the \u201cnext\u201d and \u201cprevious\u201d buttons while browsing artwork in someone\u2019s galleries \u2014 this is a technical limitation that is imposed by browsers for security reasons and was not possible to work around until now.", "id": "e527qvj", "replies": []}], "title": "Designing a social network: username in path vs username in subdomain."}
