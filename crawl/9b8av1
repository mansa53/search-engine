How substantial are the differences between es6 and 5. Would I still be able to understand and modify es5 code? Is functional programming still the prefered paradgim for writing code in JS? Does es6 support oop concepts now e.g. (encapsulation, classes, polimorphism). I have no CS background, but I've coding a bit on the side, so I think JS is a good language to learn since it's everywhere (web, mobile apps, back-end).

Also, what ide would you recommend?", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "You should absolutely learn modern JS, even if it's not compatible with everything there are some nice transpilers out there that can do the work for you. Modern JS still has all functionality of old JS (it is backwards compatible).\n\nAs for ide. I use vim, I guess that makes me weird. I've heard Atom is nice though.
