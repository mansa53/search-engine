But the next rabbit will be a little different, and you'll need to generalize for lasting success.\n\nOK the analogy is going too far here, so let's answer the real question.  I think you should learn the ideas of programming well.  Pick one language (I typically teach in Python first) and learn how programming works.  While you are doing that learn the syntax and expectations of that first language alone.  After you've had some success with that language and you are strong with the universal fundamentals, start learning new languages to see how they are similar in the most fundamental way, but different in structure and function. In our CS program I teach C, C++, and Java in our second course.  Students find the content of the class difficult, but learning three languages in the second course isn't as hard as they thought it would be, if you leaned the first language well.", "id": "e4tbxmq", "replies": []}, {"body": "No, it just goes slower.

Once you have learned these then you can apply them to any language, so learning a new language is mostly just a matter of learning the syntax.", "id": "e4thd0d", "replies": []}, {"body": "What will happen in practice is that sometimes you'll be learning Python one day and learning C the next day.
