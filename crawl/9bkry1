But this is kind of an annoying task switching between notepad and DOSBOX and then linking and debugging each .asm file. \n\nIs there an IDE where I can type code/edit code, link .obj files and run .exe files in 16-bit DOS just like I do with DOSBOX?", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Two things I\u2019d recommend if by \u201cin 16-bit DOS\u201d you mean \u201cfrom within DOS\u201d:\n\n1. If you can find a copy of the old DOS DEBUG utility, that might be a good thing to play with.  You can directly enter assembly language or raw bytes into memory (usually starting at 100\u2081\u2086), directly run/single-step through memory, disassemble memory, etc. and the dis-/assembler will ~limit you to 8086-only stuff (even if the CPU recognizes newer things).\n\n2. For a fuller-fledged IDE, look up some of the old Borland compiler packages\u2014something like Borland C++ or Turbo C maybe.", "id": "e542gb3", "replies": [{"body": "Alright, I got it.
