I realized that it would be nice to learn how to build android apps, so I decided to learn java. Do you know any good tutorials that teach java without going into the general programming stuff like data types etc. (I already know that), but still cover java from a beginners perspective. It would also be nice if the tutorial actually would show how to build something using java and not just teach the theory. \nThanks I advance:)", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "They usually recommend the University of Helsinki MOOC here. Your JS knowledge will not help you much with learning Java but don't let that stop you.

JavaScript is a very dynamic language; Java is very much *not* a dynamic language. You have far less flexibility when it comes to types here; it's more rigid and there's no automatic type coercion either.\n\nAlso, that's going to be a short part of any tutorial. I see this kind of request all the time (\"where can I learn from an intermediate perspective, I don't need the beginner stuff!\") and I always think \"well, why not just waste the hour or two it'll take you to skim those chapters and get a refresher? What are you losing?\".", "id": "e51i15x", "replies": []}], "title": "Learning Java after JavaScript"}
