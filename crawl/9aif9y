When going into a specific task I want to have the computer open up certain programs in certain locations on the screen(s).  \n\nEx. Gaming: Open Steam on monitor 1 from x,y location to x,y location.  Open Steam friends list here at this location, and so on and so forth.  The same thing with a Work launcher that opens Chrome, Outlook, and other things at set locations.\n\nLaunching the programs is the easy part,  hell I could do that all through a .bat file if I really wanted.  Try though I may, I have yet to come across anything that tells me if it is or is not possible to manually set the location and bounds of an application.  I'm open to suggestions on languages in order to get this accomplished, I've just hit a bit of a wall in terms of if it's possible.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.", "score": 3, "comments": [{"body": "Look at autohotkey or the Robot class in Java", "id": "e4vu1ak", "replies": [{"body": "I second Ahk, easily done with a few simple commands.
