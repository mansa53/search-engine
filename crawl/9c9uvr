{"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9c9uvr/feeling_like_a_speck_in_the_ocean_of_aspiring/", "text": "I've simply flirted with the idea of programming this year, jumping into a python course and stopping at the 6th episode or taking a  Codeacademy course up to lesson 3, somethings always been pushing me away from finishing it. I began to think about this more thoroughly when my aunt said she was going to take a programming course to become a web developer to get a better job, and when I heard someone at school talking about how their little brother is making a programming project with his friends.\n\n\"Seems like everyone's starting to program now.\"\n\nI felt.. disposable. \n\nNot that I believed that my cousin or the person's brother were disposable, but it was  an invasive intrusive thought. \"*So many programmers!  Who am I to jump into this when so many other people are doing it too, some for steel-like motivations? Who am I to try and learn this when there are people doing this because they have mouths to feed? Who am I to try and learn this when I've never been considered gifted or technically capable in my life, and frankly most often- the opposite?\"* This train of thinking assaulted me with every second I spent trying to learn or follow the course,  any mistake or failure or question or lack of knowledge simply making this voice in my head louder and louder, *\"You definitely can't do this!\"*  Mixed in with my general feelings of vulnerability and  being condescend upon showing lack of education to other people.\n\nI wonder why I  don't feel this way about art. When i'm making a piece, i'm not thinking about all the other people watching a drawing course or making an animation in a studio, I generally think about the piece. Maybe it's because I've seen multiple artists be appreciated for the individual unique work they do to a point that I may feel occasionally that it isn't bad that there are millions of other artists out there, because there's something that I and they individually bring to the table and that I can hone upon to make it my own for other people, and if not; whatever! I like the feeling of making lines on paper, even if it's \"garbage\" to other people. I can't deny that the aspect of not being able to make money off of my art when things get hard has scared me into putting as much time as I like, but in my heart for some reason I just enjoy it.\n\nIn programming, however, this feeling takes a quick 180. I've generally felt that my love for programming wasn't that genuine (despite these feelings being influenced by other things like this) and that I didn't seem to have anything innate being able to help me laugh even when I was stumbling on the floor wondering what this  or that is. I can't deny that some of my feelings upon wanting to program and do STEM things has been from being in a lower income family (The prospect of having to get a scholarship to do anything academically after high school has been waved to me more than anything else in my life right now), and wanting to prove all the people that said I was less capable and \"not built for this\" wrong that I can learn to do the technical things that I've wanted to do, and anyone else can, too! \n\nI generally don't possess the knowledge on any programmer topics, but despite people saying that different programmers do things differently and individual problem solving ideas are embraced in coding, I keep feeling that it's more technical and rigid, especially  when people talk about 'good' and 'bad' programmers. I already only have a brief idea of the types of programming people do for certain things, and maybe I might stumble upon something that makes me want to do it every waking second of the day, regardless of what anyone thinks. But right now, I can't even get through a single course without feeling like a nobody who doesn't deserve to try. How do I stop being fussed about all the other people  learning to program or making projects or just anything with their programs, and start focusing on how I feel going on this journey and exploring more about what programming is? How do I stop feeling like the field of programmers is so saturated and it's like a candy shop for employers to choose and spit out as they please because they'll always be someone else at the door who's just trying to feed their kids? I feel  that I don't even deserve to take up space, much less be seen as a \"\"dummy\"\" for all the things I don't know, can't solve and need help with?\n\nI don't know, i'm just lost. Has anyone else felt like this, and what did they/you do?

The only one blocking you is yourself.\n\nI too grew up in a very low income family, and did not even know about programming until I got into college haha I too had all these doubts about pursuing such field, when I found out some schools offered introductory courses or programs to introduce studens to computer programing before college.\n\n Even after taking my first introductory programing course in college, I still felt like I was behind and my peers were ahead me. However, my interest and desire to learn more about all these technologies outweighed the idea of me being left behind. I started incorporating my programming knowledge to any small problem I saw could be solved through programming. \n\nYes, I did fail a couple of classes and had to retake some more than others, but I kept at it and knew I wanted to succeed. I just graduated a couple months ago, and was able to achieve a couple job offers before graduating.

It is not an exact science.\"\n\nIt's true that programming is more rigid than many art forms but it requires creative minds to solve problems. These are same minds that are good at art.  Now when you say that there are \"good\" and \"bad\" programmers, yeah there is. Big deal. We all are bad programmers at some point. We all make mistakes. Some more than others but thats ok. It's a learning experience. Plus there is a lot of info out there. It's hard. Everybody shows off only the \"hard\" problems they've solved. It's like going on to Facebook and seeing how happy everyone is. Well duh, because they only upload pictures of themselves smiling and having a good time.\n\n[Second point that may ease your worries is this graph describing something called the Dunning-Kruger effect.](http://www.ryangeorge.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Dunnng-Kruger-insert.jpg)  Basically, once you start to learn something new, it makes sense and you confidence levels increase real quick. But once you start to learn even more, you begin to realize that you really don't know much at all even though you just gained more experience. I have a feeling that you are in the part where you start to realize that you don't know much at all.  Which is a good thing since you won't become an ignorant know-it-all type of person. Every master has been through this phase. You just gotta push through and keep learning.\n \n\nI think what you are feeling is normal. Computer Science is complicated. Career choices are complicated. Understanding who you are and what you want can be complicated. Life is complicated. When you don't know what to do, you feel lost. It does suck.\n\n\n\nMaybe programming isn't for you. Maybe it is but just at this moment it seems too daunting to continue on. I can't give you the answers but I can try and help give advice on how YOU can find those answers. One method I have tried is to keep asking myself questions. Even if they challenge my own personal ego. Ask yourself the tough questions. Answer the tough questions honestly, because if you don't you will literally be lying to yourself.\n\n* What do I want in life?\n* What do I have?\n* What do I enjoy doing?\n* Do I actually enjoy programming?\n* What about programming do I enjoy?\n* What about programming do I not enjoy?\n* If not programming, what career path should I take?\n* What am I good at?\n* What can I get better at?\n* What expectations do I have for myself?\n* What expectations do others have for me?\n* Are these expectations reasonable? Why or why not?\n* Am I motivated to do things? Why are why not?\n* Where do I see myself in 1 year? 5 years? 10 years?\n* What life style habits should I change to achieve what I want?\n\nThese are just a few questions.  You can easily ask yourself way more, but the important thing is that you actually answer them truthfully.  \n\nI realize my post may be a bit scattered but I hope it helps.", "id": "e5a7uc6", "replies": []}, {"body": "Bro, same feeling here.
