However, I'm not really sure where to start. I think I could to some unit tests but there really aren't all that many functions to test, also many of them rely on calling out the the gmail api.\n\nI'd really like to learn how to add proper tests and I feel like this is a good time to start. Does anyone have any suggested resources for starting to add testing to [my project](https://github.com/RayBB/easy-gmail-scheduler)? Should I just start with unit tests for basic functions?\n\nAny input would be appreciated!", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Mocha or something similar for unit tests.
