There, I have found new challenges, and had to deal with things I didn't even know ever existed. But since until then, all feedback about my code I have gotten is \"It compiled, yay!\" and \"Yay, it actually works like I wanted it to\", I never really knew what the best practices are. I'm sure, googling how to solve every problem and then copying a code snippet that I would reuse every time I find a similar problem didn't help my code quality either.\n\nWhile I do feel like I'm slowly improving from the feedback reviewers of my PRs are giving me, I want to know how I can learn writing better code quicker, so others don't have to deal with the code I write.", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": "For me it was working on a project over a longer period of time. I'd slowly realise why what I'd done was bad and refactor it. Reading your own code from a few months ago is pretty similar to reading someone else's code. Read up on stuff like SOLID and find out what \"code smells\" are and why they smell. Look up general good practices. \n\nAlso, best practices are as much process as code. How you commit, TDD and so on are all things that happen almost independently of what code you actually write.\n\nLastly, you're already doing this by contributing to OSS but reading other code helps you build perspective. Reading less than stellar code (chances are it'll be your own; we've all looked back at old projects and cringed) is almost as importent as good code. It tells you what to avoid.

I find going through SOME YouTubers to watch what they do. Also through the tutorials I read.
