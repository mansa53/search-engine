I'm an uni student , and intern student at some company atm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut it seems like the real business world is different than university exams. For example in the first day I came here, they wanted me to build a web service, because this is what they do atm. But I said them I never saw anything about this, I don't even know what does it mean. So I couldn't do it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo my points, it seems like going university alone won't make me good enough to get a job. I also need to learn something different. But the question is, What should I learn?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are so much things to learn in programming world. And I don't even know where to start. Seriously guys, what should I learn in next 2 years? (thats when I will graduate and find a job hopefully)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBtw in university I'm taking/took classes like Java, C, Ruby , DBMS, HTML, Data Structures & Algorithms, logic circuits , and so on. But I feel like they won't be enough!", "score": 19, "comments": [{"body": "So many people learn incorrectly.\n\nYou don't study to know things. You study to be able to study.\n\nYour classes/University are not preparing you to create a website. Your classes are teaching you concepts.\n\nYou know that a DB exists and that there are ways to optimize them. You have seen SQL basica. You know OOP exists. You know what you see in the browser is HTML and CSS to make it look fancy. You know algorithms and problem solving so you can figure out how to connect stuff.\n\nIn short... You know how to make a webserver. You just haven't done it yet. Sure, it won't be as idiomatic and clean but that comes with experience.\n\nThe point is, you can make whatever you want because you know that all these things exist. \n\nUniversity doesn't prepare you for **how** to do your job. It prepares you for **what** to do at your job.", "id": "e5biw9v", "replies": []}, {"body": "Not everyone has bad people skills but not everyone has good people skills.\nIf you think you lack the above it's definitely something you need to work on.\nWe have a guy at at our office who is great at his work but terrible at working with other.
