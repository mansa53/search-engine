Right now I am getting the price and the timestamp. The goal is to have this running all the time and have the analysis algorithms use the the previous and real-time data, but I do not know how to store the data. I was thinking a DB, but inputting new data every tenth or hundredth of a may be to time consuming? The other option I thought was to store each ticker in a csv file. Need some ideas for the data accessing to be as fast as possible.", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "The amount of data, the frequency, and the retention of data are important factors in determining the best option.\n\nIf it's a small number of stocks, it's updating often and it's not important to store long term data, I'd do it entirely in memory. That's the absolute fastest way to access and process your data with the only downside being the possible RAM requirements and data loss when the program exits.", "id": "e51z4w6", "replies": [{"body": "Ya it's about 10-20 stocks with price data coming in 10 times a second about. Then I guess after the algorithms use the data I can store it longer term. Thing is tho the program is going to be looking at maybe a whole day up to a few days worth of data is it feasible to be in memory", "id": "e5202i9", "replies": [{"body": "Why do you need data to be updated 10 times a second? Do you really care about that sort of granularity of data? Stocks rarely make any notable changes that frequently, especially from an analysis perspective.\n\nIf you only stored data once a minute or more for 10-20 stocks you could definitely store a few days worth in memory. Or even take aggregated data for every day and store that in a database if you need it later. I'm sure there's a lot of different ways to store minimal data.\n\nAnother thing you can do is test the amount of memory that certain methods will take. If you have one record then you can just duplicate it N times and see how much memory your program is using.", "id": "e520r91", "replies": [{"body": "Thank you I'll see what I can do!", "id": "e5221nk", "replies": []}]}]}]}], "title": "Storing Stock Data"}
