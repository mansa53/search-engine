I find this quite usefull because I don't have to use full Java in order to program on an android and it seems pretty powerful and easy to use.\n\nSo, I have a project in my mind, and I want to know if React Native is the right technology to do that, and if this is not too hard for a newbie like me.\n\nI have a server. On this server, there is a server's game that run h24. Problem is, in order to access and use this server, we need to connect ouselves to the comptuer using remote desktop. I find this quite useful, but only when you are on a PC. I wish we could control the server using our mobile's phones.\n\nYes, there is some remote desktop apps that I can use on mobile, but I find them quite unconvinent. So, I want to create a mobile application using ReactJs, where I can :\n\n\u200b\n\nSend console commands (the console command is a DOS console, on the server)\n\nSeeing some stats (RAM usage, Proc usage, etc)\n\n\u200b\n\nThis is the main thing about my app. In the future I would add :\n\nControl differents servers using an interface (add, remove, see list of server, etc)\n\nSecurity control (password access)\n\nFile management of the server using the mobile app\n\n... and I think for now it's all I have.\n\n\u200b\n\nWell, here we are. Do you think It's hard ? Does React Native correspond to this ?\n\nThanks for your help !\n\nSorry for my bad english, too...", "score": 3, "comments": [], "title": "A few question about an mobile app project I might start in a few days."}
