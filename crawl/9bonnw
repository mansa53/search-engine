However... time is not on my side. I'm currently in pre calculus and might change it to calculus or discrete this semester.\n\nI'm having a HUGE dilemma. My intro to CS teacher has told me he thinks I should switch to Calc. I read reddit posts of people saying Calc is really not that important as discrete is.\n\nI have until tomorrow to switch. The CS courses I plan on taking next semester are programming fundamentals, Intro to networks, and computer organization along with a math course.\n\nOr I might just take two math courses next semester.\n\nAlso the only reason I'm in pre calc is because I was worried since I haven't taken trig since high school. College level maths that I have taken are two below level algebra classes, probability and statistics, and college algebra.\n\nWhat should I do. Should I keep this Pre Calc and study Discrete over winter break and then take Calc? Or just take two math courses (Calc and Stats) next semester.\n\nMy problem seems horrible and I'm about to switch majors back to IT because of it.\n\nDo I really even need discrete before data structures and algorithms?", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Relax.\n\nDiscrete will always be helpful. You can do either and you\u2019ll be okay.\n\nThis is not a big deal.

At any rate, it'll probably take a few semesters before either topics become directly relevant in your CS class.\n\nBoth fields of math are potentially useful. Calculus is useful if you eventually want to learn more about statistics + learn about things like machine learning. (Machine learning is basically applied stats). Discrete math is useful if you want to study some of the more theoretical aspects of computer science.\n\nIt probably does make sense to continue studying calculus if you're just finishing pre-calculus. In any case, if your intro to CS teacher seems like a competent educator, I'd bias towards trusting their judgement. They'll understand the dynamics of your local school better then some random strangers on the internet.\n\nYou should also look at any future classes you want to take and look at what pre-requisite courses you need to take first. If the ones you care about include calculus as a pre-req, you should take that class first. If they require discrete math as a pre-req instead. If they don't require either, it doesn't really matter which math class you take first.", "id": "e54osw2", "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "id": "e54qh15", "replies": [{"body": "Mm, fair enough -- I was simplifying for OP, but I suppose you're correct that I should have also mentioned optimization.\n\n(Either way, calculus will be handy, which is my main point)", "id": "e54xp2n", "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": ">  Or just take two math courses (Calc and Stats) next semester.\n\ncheck to see if calc is a prerequisite for stats -- it might very well be \n\n> Do I really even need discrete before data structures and algorithms?\n\nsame here -- discrete math be a prerequisite or a co-requisite ", "id": "e54oyhy", "replies": []}], "title": "Advice for what to do for next semester?
