I want to start doing side projects and really controlling my code and school projects.\n\nThe two languages I use most are Java and C++; I like Jetbrain products so I use CLion & IntelliJ IDEs.\n\n**The Setup**\n\n*Version Control/Environments:* I would like to be able to work on the same project on either my laptop or desktop, regardless of being in a Linux or Windows environment. Should I use Git for this? I suppose I would have to set up Git in all of my environments? I saw something about Git version control built into the IDEs I use but I don't exactly know if that's worth using...\n\n*SSH:* For my Linux-based C++ class, my professor stated \"Your code must run on the department Linux machines. If you have a separate Linux installation that you want to use, ssh over to the department machines to make sure nothing breaks or just go visit them.\"\n\nBecause I have never done this last step before, I'm a little confused as to how this works. If I finish a project in CLion in my Linux environment, how's the best way to move the files to the department machine for testing? \n\nBesides a way to keep my projects together between multiple environments and a way to test on department machines, do you kind fellows of Reddit have any other advice/ideas for me  as a developing software engineering student?", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "> Version Control/Environments\n\nThere are a few things about this.  First of all, check with your school if you're allowed to put your answers on a public repository in the first place.  Some schools will not allow this.  If they're fine with it (which is very unlikely, as then everyone can see your answers), then just use an ordinary Github account.\n\nIf you aren't, then consider using a private repository.  If you're in university/collage, you can apply for a student account for Github for free.  Or you can take a look at Gitlab.  \n\nI personally just use the console for most of the git stuff I need as a student.  Just look up how to use git, it's pretty easy to use for basic tasks.\n\n> If I finish a project in CLion in my Linux environment, how's the best way to move the files to the department machine for testing?\n\nJust scp your files into the department machines, and make sure they run fine on their machines.  If you have no idea what I'm talking about, search up secure copy protocol.\n\n> any other advice/ideas\n\nDon't skip assignments as they're a good way to learn.  Sleep.  Take breaks if you're stuck.  Don't plagiarize.  \n", "id": "e5cuvh3", "replies": []}], "title": "Help me Setup as a Student!"}
