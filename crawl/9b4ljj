I know this is possible for keyboard and mouse ev ents via [hooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-at/windows/desktop/winmsg/about-hooks). But I can't find any info how to make a hook for a [pen](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/component-guidelines/pen-implementation-guide). \n\nI assumed C# in Visual Studio would be the right way to do something like this wheter as an UWP app or a WPF one. If I'm wrong, please correct me. But regardless of language and tools, I can't find a way to implement a pen hook.\n\nI also asked the same question on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52066149/hook-for-pen-input), where it got downvoted. Can someone explain what I did wrong when asking?
