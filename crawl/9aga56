If I learn Android what language do I learn to program in? Koitlin or Java? If I do hybrid do I learn reactive native or xamarin? \n\nCan someone help me out?

For example, you can spend some time expanding your knowledge on basic data structures and algorithms, if you haven't covered them already\n\n\u200b\n\nTo answer your question directly, since you already know JS, maybe learning react + native isn't such a bad idea since it allows you to develop for both platforms. I feel Angular hides away too many of the issues underlying web development to be a good learning driver. Vue 2 is quit similar to react, it also offers a component-based framework for building frontends. In the same vein, you already know Java: why not learn android through Java?\n\n\u200b\n\nTo be honest, if you're not actively working on a project, any knowledge gained working with these frameworks will fade really quickly. Personally, I can't remember most of the web frameworks I've used and I have written web applications using many of them. However, certain ideas are constant. For example, web applications need to manage some state pertaining to the currently active user. In small projects, you can get away with a hopscotch of global variables and abusing a REST API. For more complex projects you need to carefully consider how your state is stored and what actions from the UI cause your application's state to change. Another example comes from the world of high performance programs. Determining when and how memory is allocated for a high speed web server, for example, is critical to the throughput of the program. Rust lang exposes a borrowing model for memory management to address this issue because its a fairly common problem.\n\n\u200b\n\nTL;DR: Technologies are a dime a dozen, if you try to learn them all you will burn out: there simply isn't enough time. Learning one or two and understanding the problems they are trying to remedy and reasoning about the advantages/disadvantages of these solutions is infinitely more useful compared to picking up as many technologies as possible.\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b", "id": "e4v8qts", "replies": [{"body": "This is a very good answer.
