You are also able to sign up for a new user, edit comments and posts. It's not the prettiest thing in the world, it still needs a lot of work design-wise. I haven't really tested the website on a lot of devices, but it's safe to assume I will be needing more media queries. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Technologies used:** \n\n* Node\n* Express\n* MongoDB\n* Passport\n\nIt has been really hard making this app for one simple reason, I was taking care of all design and code. Yes, it's not that pretty design-wise, but with all the things going on in the back-end, I really just wanted a functional design, be it bad or not. Please check out the website and tell me what you think!\n\nYou can find the website here: [https://orbittle.herokuapp.com/](https://orbittle.herokuapp.com/)", "score": 29, "comments": [{"body": "I like the mobile design a lot. One thing I would change is the initial welcome screen. It doesn't tell you anything about what the app is, and I couldn't get to the actual content of the app until I clicked the button.\n\n\nMaybe use that screen as a landing page that you just scroll down from.\n\n\nBtw that art is very nice!", "id": "e55zzp2", "replies": [{"body": "Appreciate the feedback, I'll work on it!", "id": "e565afi", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Pretty cool!
