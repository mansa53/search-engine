But I started doing things besides programming and I found that when I sat down to continue working on projects, I was really refreshed and could grasp concepts and be more patient with myself.

Same thing as you - I work in an unrelated field, and sometimes I find it hard to come home with the gusto to \"study\".\n\nWhat I've found is good is to broaden your definition of \"studying\".  Now I have a wide array of podcasts, youtube channels, books, etc. that I'll sneak into my day here and there.\n\nThis helps on those days where you're too tired to actually sit down and write code -- the day doesn't feel like much of a waste because even listening to pros babble on on a podcast about things way above me are still \"studying\".
