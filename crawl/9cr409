I have been learning to program for about a year now casually and it's going well. I have toyed with Java and Python but I have spent most of my time learning web development stacks. HTML, CSS, JS (Node/React), Mongo/Postgre etc. The only thing I am having trouble with currently is learning about design principles for the actual web applications. A lot of the courses that I have taken for web development teach the programming guts to make web applications but always gloss over the design principles. How do I know which colors work well together, or fonts, or where should I place the navigation bars, content blocks, etc. I know that this is a creative exercise and all of those things could go anywhere you want, but I apparently don't have an eye for design because all of my web apps, while functionally/technically correct, look like complete garbage. I'm sure once I am fully comfortable with my tech stack I will be able to seek out jobs and opportunities that don't include front-end design and I can just focus on the back-end, which I like best, but in the mean time, is there any courses you can recommend for someone in my situation? Thanks.", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "I don\u2019t have specific suggestions for learning about what fonts, colors, etc to use but there\u2019s more to UI than just these superficial features. I always recommend reading The Design of Everyday Things for a general overview of user interaction (not just in software) and to take a look a the design guidelines that someone has published. [Here are the design guidelines for Windows desktop apps, for example](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/uxguide/guidelines). Design guidelines will often talk briefly about why a choice could be made and what alternatives exist.\n\nFor fonts, read about typography. Typographic guidelines are similarly published online.\n\nFor colors, read about color theory. How colors interact with accessibility is a very interesting area and accessible color schemes can often be good color schemes for those without visual impairment.
