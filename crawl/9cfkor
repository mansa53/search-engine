The problem is not that complex that I can't handle it myself, but because of company policies etc I have to go through some people. I typically do test-driven-development and mock any dependencies. However, I have been mostly working on a silo before now, and not have to interact with other teams.\n\nIs setting requirements a part of your daily work? Is this the current best practice? I have read books on TDD etc, but didn't come across writing requirements etc\n\nHow do you writing requirements, or what is the best way to learn how to do them well?", "score": 0, "comments": [], "title": "At work, is it common to create requirements from other teams?"}
