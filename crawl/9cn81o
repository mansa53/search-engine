I have average knowledge about languages like C/C++, Python, PHP. What can or should I do to earn at least $100-$200 per month.\n\nI know about freelance web development and even learned HTML, CSS, JS for it. But, I don't find web development interesting(No offence to anyone). I'm into desktop application, mobile application, machine learning, but, I haven't quite reached to that level yet.\n\nI need the money to buy a new computer since my old laptop is really slow. So, can anyone suggest what my next course of action should be? Consider that I have to make time for college work too.
