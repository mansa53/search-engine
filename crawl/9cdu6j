I was wondering, and I really do not mean to come off as condensing or anything like that. I would like to learn programming, but aside from the money, what\u2019s the point? What does it teach you in real life? For instance, working out is probably something every single human should do. We are meant to move around and be active. It\u2019s very healthy. Eating healthy takes care of you body physically and mentally. Nutrition is incredibly important. For an athlete, if I study programming, how will it benefit me in any way. If it didn\u2019t give such an amount of money, there is no way I would ever learn it. Perhaps I\u2019m wrong however, your thoughts?\n\nTypo: Condescending", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "> I would like to learn programming, but aside from the money, what\u2019s the point?\n\nNo, you actually don't want to learn programming, you just want to make money, and think programming would be an easy way to do so.

You talk about exercise, but you seem to miss the fact that it is important to exercise the brain as well.

At least compared to socializing and having a meaning in life anyway. But since this is an issue to debate, let's leave it out for now. \n\nAdvantages of tinkering about programming: \n\n**Dealing with complexity**\nFor many problems in life there is a solution which can be found by simply thinking for a few minutes. For instance, it's not too difficult for most people to come up with a packing list for the upcoming holidays on their own without using any method or structured approach. When starting programming people are, often for the first time in their life, exposed to complex problems which do not allow for a straightforward easy solution. Then you are forced to leave the comfort zone of known problem solving strategies and learn approaches to tackling complexity. This again, translates back to real-life problem solving. Have a structured approach. \n\n**Being efficient**\nThere are also many problems when working with a computer which can be solved by throwing time and effort at them. For instance, say you have many different photos collected on different folders on your computer over a long time and it's finally that you want to collect them in a single place and have them all follow a certain filename structure, say \"year_month_day_\" followed by consecutive numbering. You can do this by spending a lot of time in front of the computer, copying files and renaming them. Or, you spent 2 hours to write a tailored solution, so that the computer does the job for you in no time. This way, tedious projects become less boring, more efficient and some projects are possible which were not before because they simply would take too long to do without programming. \n\n**Being prepared for the digitalised future** \nThere is no question about that the future will make extensive use of automation and technology. Even if you are not using them professionally, it makes sense for most people to have a least a vague understanding how those technologies work. Say, you are a business person wanting to evaluate whether or not to invest into or implement some new digital product in your company. Then how do you make this decision without having a vague idea of how they work? Sure for some time, people can rely consultancy but you compile yourself being useless more and more the more the future depends on technology. \n\nFor example, take neural networks and artificial intelligence. Many people cast frightening scenarios of robots taking over the world. However, a large portion of the current methods are variants of gradient descent based backpropagation training algorithms. What that means is, parameters determining the behaviour of the algorithm are changed toward the \"most useful\" (gradient) direction with respect to some utility function. So it's basically a convergence process. For making an informed decision about the risks of such technologies, tinkering about such things is useful. \n\nThis is by far not an comprehensive list of advantages and I would not even dare to say that they are the most important ones. Just stuff I came up with while taking the tram home. \n\nEdit: clarification, spelling", "id": "e5a0e2e", "replies": []}, {"body": "It's a profession like any other, but money aside, it can be really rewarding if you come to like it.

I enjoy doing it, I don't do it for the money. I also like creating programs that can help me in life.

Computer are everywhere, cars, toasters (they have mcu - microcontroller units) , tvs and more. We've also as a society used computers and automation to better outselves. Using computers doctors can run simulations on medication and expected outcome, historians have entire libraries at their finger tips to help with research, doctors can instantly share medical knowledge that can possible save lives. In many cases, doctors can even watch a surgery remotely and make a difference in someone's well being.\n\nThe point I'm making is that the act of programming itself isn't the value, in fact it's simply a tool, the real value is building applications and programs that better our lives and better mankind. ", "id": "e5a5uir", "replies": []}, {"body": "Even basic programming skills greatly extend your ability to use computers to their full potential. Computers are an ubiquitous part of \"real life\", and are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future.\n\nAs long as you don't know any programming at all, you are utterly dependent on applications written by other people. If there isn't an application that does something that you need to do as quickly and easily as you need to do it, and nobody cares enough about your use case to write one... well, I guess it sucks to be you.\n\nIf you don't know any programming, it may not be obvious how limited your ability to use your computer is -- just like if you don't know how to drive you may be so used to being restricted to places that you can reach on foot or by public transport, and so used to planning your life around that restriction, that you aren't consciously aware of what you are missing out on.\n\nI want to emphasize that I'm not talking about being able to program at the level of a professional programmer here - I'm talking about the absolute basics, like being able to string together some shell commands into a shell script, or writing a tiny bit of Python to process some spreadsheets. This is something that I think absolutely everyone should learn how to do.\n\nPeople in all professions waste an absurd amount of time doing repetitive menial tasks on a computer which the computer could do better and faster non-interactively -- if only they knew how to tell it to do that. Instead, they spend hours clicking, typing and dragging virtualised representations of objects in interfaces which are essentially virtualised versions of manual processes which used to involve typewriters or pen and paper, and think that the tiny bit of automation that these programs offer on top of that is as good as it gets. Because programming is \"hard\", and a separate skill just for \"programmers\", and it couldn't possibly be relevant to *them*.\n\nIt's like watching someone hammering in nails with the side of a drill.\n\nIf you don't currently see any ways in which programming can immediately improve your life, you may not have spent a lot of time performing the kinds of tasks on a computer that are obvious candidates for automation. But you may need to do those kinds of tasks in the future, so learning programming now may help you later. You may also think of more ways that you can apply your programming skills in your daily life once you have acquired those skills and have a better idea of how they can be applied.", "id": "e5a7h2t", "replies": []}, {"body": "Programming used to control computers, so you basically asking \"What's the point of computers except money\".

There\u2019s more to a human than the physical. Our intellect is what made us who we are today. We live in fabricated environments that suit our needs because brilliant minds molded the world to our image. Eating a balanced and nutritious diet and going for a jog every day won\u2019t help you expand on your understanding of anything whereas programming has really helped me grow as an intellectual.
