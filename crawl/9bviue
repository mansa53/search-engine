It activates a specific light at a specific location to color a pixel, and does that however many times based on the number of pixels on your screen, right? \nSo how does the screen know what to light up? Your instructions say to light up these specific pixels in this specific way. You don\u2019t have to worry about how the instructions get to the screen, but basically some of the 1s and 0s are an address, and when the address is read, the instructions are sent to the monitor, where the 1s and 0s are turned into \u201clight up blue on this pixel\u201d\nFrom there, outside of math, repetition, and lighting up the screen, a basic app doesn\u2019t do anything else. Internet connections are just 1s and 0s to make an address with a standard format to send the information.\n\nComputers are a lot of simple things done over and over to create an illusion of complexity.  It\u2019s complex because you try to think of it from a standard viewpoint, but you need to think about how it does basic things to truly grasp how it does the complex things.
