What are some best practices? Best way to use Java in terms of interfaces, classes, etc.? How much should I know or be confident in to the point where I can pick up most ideas and put it together (especially in a freelance job for the future)? What are the key things I should know for android dev?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMoving on I have recently started iOS dev (just looked over the interface and wrote some really basic program). The same as the previous questions, what should I know for iOS dev? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like I'm kinda stuck in a box of knowledge that I know and am only able to use that box to create apps. I would really like to expand my knowledge on both sides of the dev to be able to create better and more complex apps. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all,\n\n\\-Tired\\_Dreams", "score": 18, "comments": [{"body": "What you should know highly depends on the apps you would like to make.  At the point you are at I find its best to learn on an as needed basis.  When working as a developer you may get a job that will require you to learn a package you may have never used before (ARKit for iOS as an example).  Something I did to help me through this phase was finding inspiration by looking up cool apps people have created (Through app stores, youtube, etc...) and trying to recreate them using what I know and researching what I dont.", "id": "e5c2we0", "replies": [{"body": "I understand that part but I would also like to know best practices for android dev like when should I be using classes, interfaces, abstract classes, etc. I guess that's more towards the Java side of things. \n\nSo what should I know for Java in order to be successful in android dev and what are some best practices to have and use?\n\nThank you though for answering and helping me.", "id": "e5czh0e", "replies": []}]}], "title": "Continuing as a mobile dev"}
