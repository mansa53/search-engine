The guy talks about the need for us to change the way we code. He talks about how we are required to think like computers, and that that shouldn't be the case. He live demos a program that \"live compiles\", for lack of a better term, changes that he makes and shows how the changed parameters affect a trajectory on an element in the game. Anyone know where I can find this talk or what it's called?", "score": 4, "comments": [{"body": "> he makes and shows how the changed parameters affect a trajectory on an element in the game\n\n\"Inventing on Principle\" by Bret Victor?", "id": "e56zv3z", "replies": [{"body": "This is the one, thank you so much!", "id": "e56zyyr", "replies": [{"body": "[Dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org/)\n\nThis is his vision of a new computer in the future.
