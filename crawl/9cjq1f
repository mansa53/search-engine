As shown in the Pastebin below, I'm using a do while loop. Right, when it cat or dog it stops and doesn't process the do while for some reason.  I'm not sure where I'm going wrong. Any help would be much appreciated \n\nBubble sort function: https://pastebin.com/VJFPDi0Z\nConsole output: https://pastebin.com/AiSs7TMe\n\nThank you so much!", "score": 3, "comments": [{"body": "Line 14:\n\n     if ((unsigned)intVec[i] > (intVec.size()+1)){\n\nThere is your bug. Same on line 36. \n\nThink about what you're comparing here. One of those values is wrong.  You're comparing the i^th value with... what?\n\n\n", "id": "e5b7096", "replies": [{"body": "Oooh ok. I think I get it. So since the ith would always be larger than the intvec.size()+1 that makes into an infinite loop?\n\nEDIT: Got it.
