I saw myself at some other place at this point of my life. I am currently an IT Service Desk Technician that gets overpaid for what I do. However, I work in a company that has 0 respect for any of the employees although the benefits are good as well. It seems like I am constantly stuck and unable to cross that road from IT Support to the \"next level\". I have my masters in IT but am not proficient in anything yet to get another position. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am not currently sure where I should go with my career. I was looking into all options, some of them being a Business Analyst, Project Management and possibly programming. I did pretty well in programming back in High School and College but didn't do that well when it came time for data structures etc (mostly because I was working a full time job and taking night classes). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI started to look into learning python since most of the jobs I seemed to be interested on indeed required some variation of python learning. I am mixing up my learning with reddit / codecademy / ATBS / Learn Python the Hard way (which I stopped after reading reddit reviews). However, I am afraid that I will not go passed the intro lessons of strings and numerals and learn better with a fire lit under my a$$ (in person schooling).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy dilemma is this, I am unsure whether the part time bootcamp classes are worth it. A friend of mine did GA immersive UX and told me that he recommends immersive over part time, but that would require me to quit a job with good benefits and pay while having a wife and a mortage with other expenses. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nReddit, please help!", "score": 7, "comments": [{"body": "You have financial responsibilities and no guarantee that you'll land a job after going to boot.

Let's be clear -- if you put your mind to it and the work in, both are good options. You've realized you need a change in your life and you've come to some really constructive solutions. Good!\n\nIMO both are going to get you where you need to go, the only difference is time and intensity. Yeah, the immersive is going to make it easier for you to feel...immersed... in the code, but if you go a part time and give it 110% you're going to be just as immersed.\n\nIf you think you cant afford to take time off to do immersive, then that's just a brute matter of fact; go for the part time.\n\nThe perfect need not be the enemy of the good!", "id": "e53ouz3", "replies": [{"body": "Thank you!

Plan on doing a 3 month immersive near me in september, but right now I'm doing a remote program through Hack Rector to prepare me for the campus immersive.\n\nThat said, I do recommend boot camps if you do not have any background in programming or coding. Precourse that hack reactor has, gets you ready for the immersive intensity and gives you good foundational knowledge for the programming framework. \n\nI recommend doing research to find a good boot camp program if you decide to go this route. I did a lot of research and went to some open houses for boot camps in my area before deciding my route. \n\nThe bootcamps around me weren't as high quality in my opinion. Some were cheaper, others were more expensive but after visiting some campuses, I ended up with a program which costs around the average of what I saw. \n\nI'm glad I chose a program which ranked higher nationally because the people I have met during my precourse have become good friends and I feel like I have a pool of higher quality classmates who are just as dedicated as I am to learning programming.\n\nHack reactor has a lot of options for me as well. If I ever feel like I'm falling behind the given class pace, I can reach out to an HR rep and get placed in a slower pace class or retake a class to better understand the material. I've gone through precourse twice now at no extra charge to me\n\nThey also offer remote programs where you learn from home. Sometimes going into a remote part time allows you to keep your work-life balance and learn code, while not giving up your job.\n\nI know that I speak a lot about Hack reactor but it's only because I can speak from experience as someone who's currently going through it. The people I've met in my remote classes have helped me learn coding immensely faster than if I did this on my own. The material we cover is difficult and the pace is intense. The precourse gets you use to the pace and gives you an expectation of how fast you should learn and implement new concepts on a daily basis. \n\nThe ones who struggle in boot camps are those that dont put in extra hours and try to treat the immersive the way they treat going to school at a Uni. If you dont put extra time in, you will find it more difficult going forward because each concept ends up building up to the next. \n\nThere is not a lot of help on finding the actual solution. TIs are available to look at your code and find potential bugs that you may not have seen or considered, but they are not there to do your work for you. Some people may take this the wrong way, especially after putting in the time and money.\n\nAt the end of the day, bootcamps are for profit. Though I dont agree with their practices, a lot of bootcamps will put gateing requirements for their program to up their after bootcamp employment numbers. The first week is heavy in computational programming. You will need to learn higher math concepts and be able to implement them using programming.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't want to choose any other path for me. I am such a stronger programmer today than when I started and I haven't even gotten into the meat of my immersive time yet. Bootcamps, in my opinion, are the fastest way to get from knowing nothing about programming to actually thinking the way programmers (and engineers for that matter) think\n\nIf you have any additional questions about bootcamps shoot me a DM amd I'll try to answer any questions\n\n\n", "id": "e540wry", "replies": [{"body": "Thank you!", "id": "e541f1i", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Look up Lambda School it's completely online.

Is there something you're not mentioning?  Like does your wife work and make enough to support going the immersive route?

Most programs I've seen indicate a weekly commitment of 20-25 hours each week.  If you can do more, that's additional study time you can use to solidify concepts.  I'd also recommend Learning How to Learn on Coursera.
