I got a BS in Molecular biology back in 2016 and as you can see am not really doing with it.\n\nI'm working just to help with bills around the house and really could use some advise. I'm taking a few classes at a community college like intro to java and object oriented programming, but am wondering if I should be pursing an Associates in programming?(the CC I'm in currently in offers this degree)\nor maybe getting a second bachelors?\n\n\nI still have student loans and can't really afford to stop working. because of that I'm not really thinking about a masters/2nd bachelors because I don't think I'm ready for such a hefty financial commencement.\n\nDo you think an Associates would be enough given I already have a BS? \n\nI know there are lot success stories on here, but has anyone else been in a similar situation as me and came out on top?\n\nThanks!\n", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "It highly depends on the company as to the importance of having a degree. Many smaller places will hire you just on skill alone. For that you can teach yourself and do side projects to prove your skill in a particular field.
