However, as i try to make exercises, or read, or follow tutorials. I have to keep going back, or read the same line over and over again, and i seem unable to process anything like in the first 2 to 3 weeks. Dont get me wrong i want to learn, and im not tired of it or wanting to quit. It just seems that my brain is tired. What should i do? Should i give it a break. Should i abstain from anything related to programming to maybe make my brain get the juices flowing again?\n\nI dont know if you ever experienced this. Its like when you are reading a book, and you keep havving to go back to the beginning of the page because you didnt process anything. It feels like you are an ADD. Or like when you are watching a movie, but your brain keeps thinking about some other stuff, and then you realize you are watching a scene that you dont know what the hell is going on...\n\nIf you dont experience this... Then maybe its just me that i must have some ADD...", "score": 8, "comments": [{"body": "Rest is as important to learning as study. Your brain needs downtime to process and make connections.

My role at work is more programming adjacent but involves quite a bit of going over code, and spending 45+ hours a week doing that and then studying on TOP of that can be quite hard sometimes.

Full stop, spend 30 mins or w/e doing something else (doing something without having to stare at a screen is my preference, but that\u2019s just me.) Another thing which helps me is utilizing different media. Podcasts, books, etc. Another suggestion, though it may be an odd one, is to increase the font on your IDE/text editor and double-space all the lines.
