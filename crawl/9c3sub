I'm familiar with C# and Go if we talk about *probably* suitable languages for my task. But also I don't want to use any non-default libraries. I'm not very familiar with network programming yet. I think, it might works like *download N amount of bytes -> sleep 1 second (or 1 second miuns time took for downloading N bytes) -> repeat*. Correct me if I'm wrong.\nThank you!", "score": 0, "comments": [], "title": "Limit download speed fore certain PID"}
