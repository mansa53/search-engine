Memorization doesn't matter, focus on understanding the concepts.\n\nYou can learn a little JavaScript as you go, but really learning JavaScript will be at least 10x harder than learning HTML+CSS, because JavaScript is an actual programming language, you can do pretty much anything. Learning to program takes time, there's no way around it. Memorization is also not important, learning concepts is.\n\nYou can learn SQL if you want, but there's a step missing in-between - you need to learn to do back-end programming before you can start accessing a database from a web page.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "e4y2d7e", "replies": []}, {"body": "Just learn the concepts and how it all works together.

But I *can* google and look up whatever I need to in just a few seconds, so good enough.\n\n> I'm doing this while slowly building a website that incorporates what I've learned.\n\nThis is a good idea -- keep doing that.\n\n> I'm also playing around with SQL.

SQL seems simple enough, too simple in fact, I'm probably underestimating my proficiency.\n\nProbably for the things you're trying to do, the SQL you'll write will be fairly simple.\n\nIt'll get more complex if you're trying to query for more complicated things on larger datasets where performance starts to become a concern.", "id": "e4xwl4f", "replies": []}, {"body": "> Should I master HTML before moving onto CSS?\n\nHTML is pretty basic.  Understand how it works, but you don't have to memorize every tag and attribute.  Learning the DOM, and how it all works together, is more important than html structure.\n\n> Or would it be best to learn each as I play around building my site, incorporating elements as I go on?\n\nI recommend to not learn more than one programming language at once.  Of the three you mention, only javascript is a programming language, and the others are just formatting languages.  HTML and CSS are really only complicated because of their breadth but the concepts aren't difficult.\n\nJavascript will take some time, though, so make sure you know what is going on with that.\n\n", "id": "e4xwzgx", "replies": []}, {"body": "Touch just enough to make something okay in html and css..  front end will be automated soon ", "id": "e4y7od6", "replies": []}], "title": "I'm learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
