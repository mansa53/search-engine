In general you're looking at raw input / output from the socket, and most of the information you're looking for is going to be contained in some kind of response coming through after you make a request on that open socket. \n\nSorry I can't be less generic when it comes to python, when I learned to write a scanner it was using the nmap libraries (since i learned from Violent python)", "id": "e53px0x", "replies": []}], "title": "How would I go about building any app"}
