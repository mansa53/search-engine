The term is a bull shit marketing term. \n\nI\u2019ve been doing development for awhile. And honestly, the term is like \u2018dev-ops\u2019. It\u2019s just an all encompassing term for hiring managers. That\u2019s all. \n\nSo to your question. If making things pretty interests you, then look at CSS and a front end framework (react/angular..). However, for someone starting out in development I would highly recommended raw JS. It\u2019s instance feedback on your progress. \n\nIf making the bits go interest you then  honestly look at python, php....ruby (I hate ruby, hence the pause.  personal pref). This route lead me down the road to learn SQL, and normalization. \n\nAnyway, there is no such thing as \u2018full-stack\u2019. You will excel at one, or the other. One will just be a pain in the ass to make what you want happen go. \n\nThis is totally an opinion. And please take this for what it\u2019s worth. \n\n", "id": "e4sqtr1", "replies": []}], "title": "The path to Full Stack. I need some advice."}
