{"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9b1lan/need_advice_learning_web_development/", "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI was wondering whether some of you could orient me towards a path to learn some web development. A little bit of background: I program almost daily in c++ and python, so I am not a complete beginner. I have even dabbled a bit into Haskell if that reassures you.\n\n\u200b\n\nHowever, when it comes to programming for the browser, I am at a complete loss. First of all, I cant get my head around as to why I need to learn three languages: HTML, CSS and Javascript. I have tried to surmount this hindrance many times in the past to not much avail.\n\n\u200b\n\nWhenever I try again to get back into it, I remark a proliferation of new JS frameworks and what not. So I end up throwing my arms in the air and turning my back to the whole endeavor.\n\n\u200b\n\nHowever, recently I have become interested again in the idea but with a concrete aim in mind. I do a lot of data-analysis (STEM grad student), but I would like to be able to present my work in a more interactive fashion which can be easily shared by people everywhere. These two constraints are ideally solved by the web since I can just send a link to my work without the person at the other end having to set up some specific environment.\n\n\u200b\n\nSo my question really is: how does one go about doing web-development in 2018? Where do I even begin? I looked into React and Elm. Would that be a good place to start?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, it would be great to have some definitive resources on understanding the whole DOM idea, and the front-end/backend separation. I am aware that it is probably not as relevant to web development, but I want to have some kind of decent mental model. \n\n\u200b\n\nThanks for your help. Cheers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: added further details.", "score": 13, "comments": [{"body": "Begin by learning HTML, CSS and JS. All of these a required for learning react so that would be a bad place to start.\n\nThese 3 languages have very different usages\n\n* HTML - Place items on screen\n* CSS - Style items placed on screen by HTML\n* JS - Make the website interactive\n\nYou can learn these languages and the DOM using websites like free code camp or youtube channels like [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb) and [mmtuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3CWlfZUvL8).\n\nThe interactivity that you have described can be done using JavaScript with a library like [D3 JS](https://d3js.org/) or [Charts JS](https://www.chartjs.org/).\n\n\u200b\n\nFor the backend you can use Python with frameworks like Django or Flask (I don't know python so I haven't used these). In  a project like you described you would use your backend languages to store the data that you want to display and then use your front end languages to actually display them.\n\n\u200b\n\nTLDR, Learn HTML, CSS and the basics of JavaScript first and don't bother with front end frameworks for now.", "id": "e4zp8pi", "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for your reply.  So there really is no other way than learning 3 separate languages at a time to do some web development? \n\nCan anyone explain why it is so hard to do stuff on the web?

", "id": "e4zwbec", "replies": [{"body": "It sounds a lot more complicated than it actually is. There is very little that you need to learn to use HTML as all it is is a few tags to tell the browser what that item is. CSS is a little more complicated but you can do a good amount with basic CSS, especially if your website is more focused on displaying data. JS is the most complicated of the three but you will probably pick it up very quickly as you already know C++ and Python.\n\nYou will need to learn a framework for Python as it will drastically reduce the amount of code you need to write, make your code cleaner and will reduce your chances of having security vulnerabilities like SQL injections etc\n\nOnce you've had some practice with these languages you will see how well they fit together and the whole process will seem less convoluted", "id": "e4zx8f5", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "D3 looks great though..", "id": "e4zwc20", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "There is a book called [Resilient Web Design](https://resilientwebdesign.com/).
