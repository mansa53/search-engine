Have there been proven benefits to taking notes?", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "This is not practical. You'll never get through the book and it sounds like you are going to just be writing you own book based on another.  Get out there and program.

Absolutely.\n\nNotes for the sake of taking notes, maybe not so much.\n\nI make these so-called cheat sheets with every new language to help me remember the code until I've solidified my understanding enough to recall it straight from memory.\n\nTry that and see how you do going forward.", "id": "e5csu44", "replies": []}, {"body": "I personally find the best way I learn from a book is to read through it and just absorb.  If there's something I really don't get then maybe jot a note down.
