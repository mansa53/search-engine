After college I took a job that didn't touch those two languages and instead all my work was done in both JavaScript and Python.\n\nI recently got accepted into a Masters program and the classes use C/C++, Java, and Python.\n\nIs there any book out there I can read to quickly refresh myself over the next month for both C++ and Java. I know many will say just work on a project or something but I'm not smart enough to think of a project that'll allow me to use all the different functionality and quirks the language has to offer. I'd rather just read a book on it and do a few quick practice problems.\n\nEdit: Not one book that covers all, but one book per language", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": ">  the classes use C/C++, Java, and Python.\n\nThose are four completely different languages, so \"one book\" - nope.", "id": "e504pbu", "replies": [{"body": "sorry i wasn't being clear, I'm looking for one book for C++ and another book for Java", "id": "e504vgc", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "C++ - A Tour of C++ by Stroustrup or C++ Primer by Lippman.\n\nJava - Core Java vol.1 or Introduction to Java by Liang\n\nPython - python.org [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/index.html)", "id": "e50njqu", "replies": []}], "title": "Any good refresher books for C++ and Java that are under 300 pages each?"}
