I noticed that some of the targets, `clean` for example, didn't have an accompanying `.PHONY` line. I have so far been unable to find information online indicating that this is possible, or why, and yet the makefile worked just fine. Can anyone tell me why?", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2145590/what-is-the-purpose-of-phony-in-a-makefile\n\nThe absence of `.PHONY` won't necessarily make a phony target not work. It just *might* not work, if there happens to be a file with the same name as the target in the local directory. `.PHONY` will ensure that this never happens. But since people seldom have a file called `clean` lying around in their build directory, they sometimes don't bother to add `.PHONY`.", "id": "e53vv5q", "replies": [{"body": "So basically using it wherever applicable can be considered a best practice, because even if I think I can get away without using it, it protects me from my own stupidity.", "id": "e53xpo5", "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, you can imagine someone (not necessarily yourself) creating a `clean` file for whatever reason (a backup copy of a file they're modifying, or whatever) and then thinking that your Makefile sucks because that target is broken.  `.PHONY` is cheap insurance.\n\nThat said ... I'm bad about being explicit about phony targets.  The chances that it's going to be a problem are pretty low.", "id": "e53zmio", "replies": []}]}]}], "title": "Make: Why do some phony targets not require \".PHONY\"?"}
