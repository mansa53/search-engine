I have the Dell XPS 9560 the 4k model and had to install DrJava which I'm meant to use for my assignments but for some reason the program is tiny and microscopic and barely visible. Are there any ways to fix this or what other program can I use for my assignments.\n\nEdit: Found the fix, thanks to u/YuleTideCamel and some online searching. I closed DrJava and changed my resolution to one really low and opened DrJava and it was no longer tiny. From there I just went up the list of higher resolutions to one it still supported. Thanks to everyone who commented you were all great help.", "score": 3, "comments": [{"body": ">the 4k model\n\n...\n\n> for some reason the program is tiny\n\nIt's because you're using a 4k display, and from what I can tell, DrJava doesn't seem to support HiDPI correctly. You presumably have a scaling factor turned on in Windows or you'd have the same problem with all of your applications, and it appears that DrJava doesn't respect that setting and uses native pixels to render.\n\nYou can \"fix\" this by reducing your actual resolution while using DrJava, or you can use other means to write and compile Java. (This could be installing something like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, all the way down to using Nodepad++ to write and `javac` on the command line to compile).
