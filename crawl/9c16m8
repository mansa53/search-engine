I cleared the first online round which had technical and aptitude and then came the interview.\n\nHe started with \"Tell me about yourself\". I introduced myself, I wasn't loud basically because I was a bit nervous. First interview after all. So he told me to be a bit louder. I started again.\n\nThen he asked my about my favourite subjects. I told in languages I like Python and Java and Operating Systems. I was really nervous should have thought for a second and then answered the question.\n\nHe then proceeded to ask me questions on Java. Features of  Java and other basic questions. I answered them.\n\nHe the wrote my name of a sheet of paper and asked me yow write a program to find duplicate characters. I told him I'll write it in python. I'm well versed with python and use it wo solve problems on Hacker rank and Hacker earth. He said you told me your favourite language is Java. I said I can also do this in Java but I don't remember the syntax of maps. I'll use dictionary in python. He said okay whatever you like. I solved the problem. He asked if this is correct I said yes.\n\nThen asked me to write a sorting algorith. I said I'll write Selection sort. He said anything other than selection sort. I said okay bubble sort. He said not bubble sort. He then asked me to write the algorith of Insertion sort. I wrote the algorithm.\n\nAgsin asked me to describe a project of mine. I did that. Then again some Java questions.\n\nBasically 90 percent of the questions were from Java.\n\nHe then asked me a puzzle. Which I answered. Don't know if I was right or wrong.\n\nThen asked my whether I has studies any database subject. I said we has DBMS last semester. He asked me to write a couple of easy queries which I did.\n\nLastly he asked the difference between array list and linked list. I mention 3 differences.\n\nHe then said okay. You can wait outside. 30 mins later i found out I wasn't shortlisted for the HR round.\n\nI was a bit disappointed, specially since I thought the interview went pretty well. but I'll take this as a learning curve.\n\nI think my biggest problem was my body language, I was nervous and everytime I tried to remember something I looked way from the interviewer, outside the window. And it was clearly visible that I was nervous. I was stuttering was speaking.\n\nAny advice anyone has which can help me the next time around. Also English isn't my native language.\n\n", "score": 4, "comments": [{"body": "I've been told I interview well and have generally been very successful in interviews, so here's my take. \n\nA good interviewer is going to structure their questions to start off simple and then delve into detail, asking subsequent questions about your answers to determine your depth of knowledge. A bad interviewer is going to ask for recitation of common problems. In the event you deal with a bad interviewer, try and force yourself to go into detail and explain why you do something. \n\nSecondly - an interview in person is not primarily to determine your competency, it's not a test of your skill. The technical portion may look like that on the service and is important, but the interaction with the interviewer is the most important part. They're looking to see if you fit with the culture, if they want to work with you, and if you can learn to grow to fit their needs. \n\nAnd just general tips, you should walk away from the onsite knowing generally what you would be working on and who you would be working with/reporting to. If they don't tell you, ask. You should always have 2-3 questions prepared for each interviewer, and try and get them to talk about their work and the company. It's a conversation, not a quiz.

I was given it before my first interview at 18 and have used it in every interview since (now 32).\n\nIf they offer you water at the start of the interview, take it even if you aren\u2019t thirsty. If they don\u2019t offer you any, ask for some (or worst case scenario, bring your own). Whenever you start feeling nervous and need a few seconds to come up with an answer, take a slow sip of water. The water will calm you, give you time to think and won\u2019t give away your nerves to the interviewer. ", "id": "e57e1ct", "replies": []}, {"body": "Honestly. I think most interviewers understand people are nervous. You should probably learn to speak up though. \n\nThe most likely reason you weren\u2019t short listed was they wanted you to solve problems in Java, not Python. There was very likely several other people that could solve the problems in Java.\n\nIf you don\u2019t mind, could you expand on the answers that you just wrote \u201cI answered them\u201d. What did you answer for the difference between a linked list and array list, for example. ", "id": "e57ya15", "replies": [{"body": "I told him that Linked lists use doubly linked lists whereas array lists are synamic resizable lists. Array lists are indexed whereas linked lists aren't. Insertion in linked lists are faster than array lists. I mentioned these differences.\n\nI actually asked him if I could solve it in python and he did say yes.\nBut he wasn't impressed. ", "id": "e57z6p0", "replies": [{"body": "None of your answers are technically always correct for the lists.\n\nInsertion at the head of a large linked list is likely always faster than a large array list, but insertion near the end of a large array list can easily be faster than a linked list. Linked lists are not necessarily always doubly linked. \n\nWhat they were probably after is that an array list is backed by an array, which makes indexing into it constant time while indexing in to a linked list is O(n).\n\nBeing backed by an array has necessary issues though:\n\n1) inappropriate grow factors or starting size causes a lot of full array copies which are slow\n\n2) insertion means copying every element after the insertion point over which makes it potentially slow\n\n3) adding to the end can even be slow, assuming it causes a grow() call\n\nIf I was an interviewer in that situation, I wouldn\u2019t have accepted your answers, or I would have asked you to clarify them.

Maybe that was because I was nervous as this was my first major interview. But I sure wasn't whispering. ", "id": "e57jc56", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "One major issue I've experienced during my interviews is miscommunication. This would be common for you if you're socially awkward and unengaging like I am. \nSo when in an interview, be sure that the interviewer gets each and every word you say and also the other way round. You should be able to understand every question clearly. For example in the sorting algorithm question, when he rejected selection sort you should have gotten an idea that he sought an algo with a lesser complexity. Try to be confident but also precise. Don't shoot arrows in the dark, I say from my personal experience. Also I assume your resume is well prepared.\nLast but very important, always try to get information on what kind of skills are required for the post you're applying for. Do prepare accordingly.\nThat's all I can suggest to you from my meager experiences.", "id": "e57jfrb", "replies": [{"body": "Thanks this helps, I am as you mentioned socially awkward and not good with people.
