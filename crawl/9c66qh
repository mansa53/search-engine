I went across a few offers however they did specify that the degree I would be getting would be in Digital and Technology Solutions. Now, I am no expert, so is this some sort of equivalent of SE? Can I still get a job in SE with this sort of degree?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n [Here is a BBC website link is you want to check it out.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/careers/trainee-schemes-and-apprenticeships/technology/software-engineering-degree-apprenticeship)", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "Judging by this: https://www2.mmu.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/course/bsc-digital-technology-solutions/\n\nIt seems like it's a bit of watered down SE degree (if you choose the SE track). \n\nAt any rate, the debt argument isn't a very good one. Your earning potential is fairly high with an SE degree and employment security is also pretty high, so having ~30k or something in debt is really not such a big issue. \n\nDon't fail to consider lost earning potential due to a worse degree/program. That could far exceed any debt you incur. Of course, if you drop out of your program and fail to graduate, the debt can be a significant issue. \n\nAlso, as usual, I recommend you look into doing a proper CS degree over an SE degree. A CS major can do anything an SE major can do, plus lots more. (You won't necessarily learn everything a SE major would learn, but you will learn the skills/fundamentals to learn those things as needed.)", "id": "e58eo1r", "replies": []}], "title": "Software Engineering - Apprenticeship?"}
