What I have been doing is creating a project named \"Sandbox\" and basically creating a new class file for whatever I want to test, like data structures or approaches to solve a problem. This works okay, but I would like to save everything I do for future reference, and it looks messy when there's so many files in the project. Also, presentation aside, there are the issues when I have more than one class of the same name and it gets confusing remembering which classes are dependent on each other, etc. \n\nIs there a better way to go about this?", "score": 1, "comments": [], "title": "Best way to organize/setup a sandbox for academic coding purposes?"}
