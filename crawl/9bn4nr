I'm not sure if I should choose between gdi or directdraw, I'm hoping the latter is a bit faster. It sure is easier to work with images in directdraw, with gdi you have to create a .bmp file in memory first.\n\nSo, I created a program that moves a square from left to right. It moves fast when the window is small, but slow when big. Can I speed it up somehow, maybe by using dirty rects and covering only the \"part where the square been\" with the background color? Or it wouldn't change anything?\n\nAnother thing is, I have a computer with a fried videocard chip. On that pc, direct3d9 fails to init, yet some kindof 3d games still run, albeit slowly. (For example, hellsinker, the only 3d there is rotation). I guess that's due to emulation? Maybe I should use some 3d api instead, since it will be emulated for 2d machines?", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "DirectDraw has been dead for over a decade now I think, and even when it was active it wasn't very good, you need 3d apis to get anywhere near decent graphics performance.", "id": "e54r3bj", "replies": [{"body": "but how to write games and apps for pc without 3d hardware?\n\nboring, oblivious, lazy answer.", "id": "e54rbrf", "replies": [{"body": "Every machine made within the last decade has 3d hardware, if it's not dedicated then it's integrated into the cpu.
