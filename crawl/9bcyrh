I want to create something similar to following page: [https://wordcounter.net/website-word-count](https://wordcounter.net/website-word-count)  \n\n\nIt should count words on a website but do also more like searching for specific words and word combinations and give you an output.  \n\n\nWhich programming language do I need to learn to create something similar on my own? Maybe someone has already a good article to read to create something similar? I am not even sure what to Google...  \n\n\nThanks for your answers :) ", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Python would be a good choice for this, because since it's a scripting language it's designed to be good at taking large texts and doing basic parsing/searching/other data operations.\n\nIn particular, Python has a library called BeautifulSoup (https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) that takes care of importing text from websites.\n\nIf you plan to make a website out of this, then you'd attach the Python backend to a standard HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend, and there's many guides on the Internet about that.
