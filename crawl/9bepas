Release date comes along and guess what? The fields are null, so of course production breaks.\n\nWhich is fine to a point, stuff happens. But the frequency of these problems is ridiculous.

So, OK, whatever. Turns out this thing is the biggest piece of shit I've ever seen. Just an absolute fucking mess in every way you can imagine, and a few you can't. I spent a week just trying to figure out how it worked ... and failed. I was more confused at the end of the week than I was at the start. I tried following one piece of data through the workflow, and couldn't do it. I would have never thought it was possible to build something this badly and still have it function.\n\nSo I said \"This thing sucks way to badly to risk modifying, if you want it changed, it's gonna be easier to just build you a new one, so put in a new project request.\" Which they didn't want to do because that's more work for them.\n\nThey didn't like that and pushed back. Managers were called. Meeting were held. At some point, somebody made a PowerPoint. \n\nI slow walked the issue in every way I possibly could until they stopped complaining, partly because I lied and said \"Fine, I'll work on it in my spare time and get it done eventually\".\n\nThen when the person who was the other department's point man on the issue moved to a new role I just closed out the change request and that was that.", "id": "e53n8px", "replies": []}, {"body": "Decision-making business people are the hardest parts of any of my projects.", "id": "e53g9tv", "replies": []}, {"body": "Working between an inconsistent WebService and a bullshit frontend as an intermediary API", "id": "e53awap", "replies": []}, {"body": "The hardest projects for me are always those where the client asks for the impossible and you somewhat have to get a solution which is getting \"close\" to it.
