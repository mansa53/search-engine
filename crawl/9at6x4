Everything that deals with the logic behind programming, everything under the Discrete Structures, Logic and Computability umbrella. I have a text book on the subject but its just convoluted,  i could not find a good free source on the subject either, and looked at the F.A.Q's on the subreddit and did not find what i was looking for. Whats a free simple source to learn these things? Thank You !", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Watch a lecture from MIT OpenCourseWare?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3LMbpZIKhQ&list=PLB7540DEDD482705B", "id": "e4xwvg3", "replies": [{"body": "Thank You !!!!", "id": "e4xx5zj", "replies": []}]}], "title": "Discrete Structures, Logic and Computability"}
