If you just want to run it, download the binary and run it.\n\nOtherwise you have to build it - that means compile it from source so that you can run it.\n\nA building dependency is something else you have to install first before you can build.\n\nOne of the things that's really cool about Linux is that lots of really common software is already packaged for you, and you can install it super easily from the command line! For example, to install opencv, you could just type:\n\n    sudo apt-get install opencv-dev\n\nIf that's all greek to you, I'd read a tutorial on Ubuntu package management first.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "e52cv8w", "replies": []}], "title": "What are building dependencies, and how to build from binaries?"}
