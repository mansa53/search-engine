I am trying to find a way to append the total price in the shopping cart to the url....for example in the code, you notice how the total price is 17.99, i need a way to automatically change a link based on that price. For example in this instance, I would like the end result to link to [https://example.com/checkout?amount=17.99](https://example.com/checkout?amount=17.99) , changing the \"17.99\" based on what is wrapped in the span tags.\n\n`<span class=\"woocommerce-Price-amount amount\"><span class=\"woocommerce-Price-currencySymbol\">$</span>17.99</span>`\n\n\u200b", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "It seems you may have included a screenshot of code in your \npost \"[Append Span to end of URL](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9c2bop/append_span_to_end_of_url/)\".\n\nIf so, note that posting screenshots of code is against \n/r/learnprogramming's rules: please **edit** your post to use one of the \n[approved ways of formatting code](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_formatting_code). \n(Do NOT repost your question!
