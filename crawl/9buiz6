My highest math was College Algebra, Probability and Statistics. At my CC you had to take College Algebra > Trig ( only 2 credits ) >Calc. \n\nI was only taking Pre-calc here because I don't remember Trig. My comp sci teacher thought I should just drop pre-calc since it doesn't count to my major like Discrete does. \n\nI have heard that I can take discrete before pre calc or trig. \n\nNow, I purchased two courses on Udemy. One for Trig, one for Pre Calculus and Trig. Can I learn all those three and just expect to be ready for calc? \n\nMy teacher told me alot of people don't remember trig functions but take calc anyway.
