So far I've had experience with some Ionic projects in the real world, Cordova and Phonegap in some personal adventures.\n\n\u200b\n\nI am looking for advice on which technology to focus in the long list of cross platform technologies. After reading some articles, browsing reddit and so on, I see that out of the list for small cross platform technologies, the ones that are more supported are React Native (RN) and Flutter.\n\n\u200b\n\n**I need advice on which one to take out of these two**, I know reddit and half of twitter and medium hates RN, and the main support is [Airbnb article](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/react-native-at-airbnb-f95aa460be1c)  but have in mind that I'm mostly a web developer who's just adventuring and would like to learn ReactJs at some point (I've seen a lot of praise to the way they handle components, and personally I've liked the examples I've seen). On the other hand I wouldn't like to spend months into a technology that will be dead in a year from now and having to start over, having Google support makes Flutter the almost go to if it wasn't because I enjoy being a Web Dev in general.\n\n\u200b\n\nSo here I am asking for help to some internet strangers.", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "React Native.
