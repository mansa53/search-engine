Used to write intranet applications for small business. Anyway, I tend to let my files get pretty long as I just code the entire page in one file (Divs, tables, etc.). Is there a good rule I should follow or process to avoid this?\n\nOr is it just a matter of logically breaking it and using INCLUDE statements?", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Do you use templates and leave the business logic outside of these?
