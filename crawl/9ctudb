But there is none to deliver you an audio only stream for a Youtube video.\nThere are some APIs, which give you different links for a Youtube video like audio-only links with different bitrates, BUT they want 5$ for some requests, because they worked so hard to get this work and now they want some money. That's bullshit.\n\nAfter some research work with different APIs and libraries and researching source code, I just tried it by myself and wolla.\n**Spoiler:** audio only links are in the page source of each video.\n\nYou just have to know what you are looking for ;)\n\nOpen a youtube video, view page source and search for \"mime%3Daudio\". There should be 5 matches (5 audio-only links with different bitrates), one full url for example looks like this in the page source:\n\n\"https%3A%2F%2Fr2---sn-35cxanpbo5a-8pxl.googlevideo.com%2Fvideoplayback%3Fsource%3Dyoutube%26signature%3D30EC556F55533FBFD9003767730D10556681F33A.B12E021CA54CCB9E225F58A4430E9BB528081FB5%26requiressl%3Dyes%26expire%3D1527306011%26clen%3D3064602%26initcwndbps%3D1152500%26ipbits%3D0%26mime%3Daudio%252Fmp4%26dur%3D192.911%26fvip%3D5%26lmt%3D1524946334873350%26key%3Dyt6%26sparams%3Dclen%252Cdur%252Cei%252Cgir%252Cid%252Cinitcwndbps%252Cip%252Cipbits%252Citag%252Ckeepalive%252Clmt%252Cmime%252Cmm%252Cmn%252Cms%252Cmv%252Cpl%252Crequiressl%252Csource%252Cexpire%26itag%3D140%26gir%3Dyes%26ip%3D81.217.53.239%26id%3Do-ALNxMeQYw4LLc1FAjxt4h795wKTdqJnzc_SBgzEJVBxR%26c%3DWEB%26keepalive%3Dyes%26mm%3D31%252C29%26mn%3Dsn-35cxanpbo5a-8pxl%252Csn-2gb7sn7r%26ei%3Du4IIW7DfC46rgAfrrpnICw%26ms%3Dau%252Crdu%26mt%3D1527284230%26pl%3D16%26mv%3Dm\"\n\nJust only have to decode the URL (base64) and you got what you want. An audio only link for a youtube video. ;)\nThere are also other links, e.g. an video link of the Youtube video with different resolutions. Search for \"mime%3Dvideo\".\n\n**But now, here are the problems.**\n\nFirst of all, you are not allowed to promote this audio-only links due to Youtube terms.\n\nSecond, this only works for non-licenced videos like private ones.\nIf you try to get an audio link of an licenced video, the url won't work and will give you a 'Permission Denied' error.\n\nThe problem is here: [See example](https://ibb.co/jojC9d)\n\nThe signature in non-licenced videos is in the URL itself like e.g. \"...&s=ABCD\", but at licenced videos, the signature is not directly included in the URL. In addition, the signature is encrypted. So, e.g. the audio-only-link will not work, if you just append the signature to the URL. Its encrypted with cipher. \n\nI wrote a really dirty PoC to crack an cipher algorithm there and it worked!!!...for 1 day. [See Example](https://pastebin.com/0hE7aL4Q)\nYoutube changes the cipher algorithm each day (Youtube includes an audio-player in the page, which has the algorithm and this player changes each day).\n\nIf your brain is thinking about some evil things like sharez or whatever, the signature is encrypted with your IP (whether is licenced or non-licenced). So you can't share your audio-only links with others. (or a server with clients, EXCEPT the server will download the audio file and distribute this to your clients, which is higly illegal, just to mention for the devils out there)\n\n**Conclusion**\nFor private usage with non-licenced videos, it works to get the audio only links. With them, you can build you own app (like Youtube Music ;) ) FOR PRIVATE USAGE!\nAudo-only links with licenced videos is a bit tricky, but if you want to crack the cipher algorithm each day, it will work too.\n\nHave fun and let me know your further findings!", "score": 8, "comments": [{"body": "[removed]", "id": "e5d7sxl", "replies": [{"body": "This subreddit allows only **English**", "id": "e5d9avs", "replies": []}]}], "title": "Youtube Music app for free?
