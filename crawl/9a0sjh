(make a task manager, assembler, front & back of angular web app, and a few others.) I'm not looking to learn so much as I'm looking to get some certs under my belt. I desperately want to get out of ZA (ideally to USA) and it seems anything that'll help me land a job overseas will help. Does anybody know of any resources/bundles/sites similar to StackSocial or ItsFOSS that regularly have pay-what-you-want or otherwise just fairly affordable bundles specifically focused on certs? I saw last week there was a great cert bundle at ItsFOSS including COMPTIA and a few others but I had no monies at the time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance.", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Humble Bundle is might be what you're looking for.
