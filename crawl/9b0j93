It has a header, a body, a footer. Footer links are like toes, asides are like arms, etc\n\nBox model is kind of like Legos. There's big bricks, plates, tiles, etc.\n\nGrid system is like an electrical grid. There are grids and subgrids\n\nTaxonomy is used in explaining class inheritance (mammal \u2192 animal \u2192 dog)\n\nAny there any other good analogies? I'm developing my own mini-css framework so I'm wandering what to name things, etc. Would help just using an long thought out analogy for everything", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "This is where I forget every programming analogy I've ever heard", "id": "e4zezbv", "replies": []}, {"body": "Everything must be a car analogy.
