I pushed the directory to a github repository, all good. I later deleted the repo from github but did not delete the files off my computer. Now, I have another project called B which I want to push to an entirely different new repo on github. I follow the instructions from where my directory is (git remote add origin https://git..., then git push -u origin master) but what happens is my files from project A get pushed to the repository instead. What's going on??", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Did you run \"git init\" again on your new project? It sounds like you are reusing your old repository.
