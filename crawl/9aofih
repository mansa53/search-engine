Now which one should I learn -  Web Application Development Using [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) Core 2.1 or Android App Development? I am a bit frustrated with myself. I have learnt the basics, but haven't managed to create any real world apps. I am looking for practical video courses that will help me to build either practical web or Android app. But haven't managed to find one. I am also confused about which path to choose. Right now, I am creating website template (intermediate level) using Photoshop. I feel that I need to focus on building apps as well, as I am really passionate about coding. But I can't find any practical course. As a result, I am losing my interest and motivation day by day. I need to get involved with practical app projects to get them back and succeed.
