I've read that it would be good for you if you have some kind of project in mind that you would want to create, so at first I haven't come up with anything, but then after searching for good university I would wan't to join I came up with an idea.\n\n**I want my project to look something like this:**\n* It is a web page,\n* It calculates your score from an very important high school exam (Im from Europe)\n*Then, based on these calculations, it shows you possible universites that would accept your resume based on your score\n* For example, if you had 80% for advanced math, 50% from national language, and 90% from advanced english, it would then show you couple of universities in your nation, then when you click one of them (expand), it will show you possible fields you could apply to.\n\nMy deadline for this project is 10 months, could I do it in that time? I want to have something on my github to be employable in IT field in 1 year or so, is that even possible? Thanks.\n\n", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Yeah that\u2019s possible, if you want to do it in pure Python you could use Django or flask. But the requirements for this are pretty low so maybe HTML/CSS with Python running the script\u2019s to make the calculations required. \n\nDo you have any data avaliable or do you still have to find University data with acceptance rates etc.?", "id": "e53bay4", "replies": [{"body": "I still would have to find the university data, which means that I would have to know the minimum points required to be accepted to a given field, and almost every university has diffrent way to calculate these points. Every year the data changes, so it would be good to be able to change on site (as an admin). I don't know if that makes sense.", "id": "e53ck9z", "replies": [{"body": "Yeah that makes sense, I'd look into some tutorial using django as a back-end. The back-end is essentially the scripts that run a website's functionality.\n\nHere's a source:\n\nhttps://www.quora.com/How-do-I-use-python-as-back-end-for-HTML-for-processing-queries-and-returning-data-to-HTML-for-updating-the-information \n\nI think the data will be hard to come by and will have to be done by hand.

What I mean is, how are you going to know what scores you need for which programs in what schools, all across Europe?", "id": "e53g8nv", "replies": [{"body": "It's not for universities all across Europe, it's just for my country. There are given minimum points for each field in universities page. For example, one university could calculate these points something like this: Points = x*1+y*0.2+z*0.6 where x is score in mathematics, y is national language and z is english. Of course it differs between universities, so each of them will have different points calculation method. And minimum threshold for the points in a given field changes every year based on the last accepted student (or so I heard), so for, let's say, in 2017 CS you would have to get 100 points (which could mean 65% in mathematics) and in 2018 CS you would have to get 130 points (85 in mathematics).", "id": "e53ko6c", "replies": []}]}], "title": "What language I should choose for my project?"}
