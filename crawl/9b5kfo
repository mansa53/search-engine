Often they have nice features but they are not zero cost. PyCharm for example takes longer to start up and scan all the files (while it is scanning I really don't feel like using it because the response time is too low). Also, it takes longer to figure out how to do simple things the first time (e.g. how do I run this .py file, i.e. python foo.py)?\n\nOnce you've figured out these things, though, sometimes the IDE can streamline some processes. For example PyCharm is pretty good about analysing your code as you type it, so it can do things like catch typos which Python does not check. On the other hand, command line tools like pylint can also do this if you use them in a build or run script from the command line.\n", "id": "e50psf7", "replies": []}, {"body": "I would suggest just watching some video about your specific ide because they provide you with a lot of other functions that are vital to success because they can cut your process time in to one fifth.
