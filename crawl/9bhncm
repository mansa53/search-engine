Then, after they get past that obstacle, it's impossible to 'unlearn' what got them through it and think in a way they did beforehand. \n\nAll that means I lost a chance to improve how I teach/help with that certain obstacle that someone else who is new is very likely to replicate.", "id": "e53auh4", "replies": []}, {"body": "> to!\n\nSyntax error.

Not only that, but to be able to travel the world without needing to save up vacation days, etc... And this was my first job out of college.\n\nI was born and raised in Boston and lived there my whole life, and the job actually gave me a chance to relocate to Los Angeles. If I could have done things over again with another programming language, I probably would have, so I guess it was moreso the opportunity itself and the freedom it provided me. Go was just a part of that deal, haha. **Edit: spacing**", "id": "e53u3t6", "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "I do see a lot of PHP hate, but I don't see too many people saying not to learn it.  Everyone seems to acknowledge that it's the dominant back-end language with the most job opportunities.  I'm currently learning node/express and mongo/mongoose, but I'm well aware that I'm limiting my marketability in the short term by doing that.\n\nMy question is, how much effort should I really be putting into learning the back-end as a beginner?  The goal of a lot of these bootcamps and online \"complete beginner web dev\" courses are to teach full-stack development.  When I first started learning web dev, I thought the most logical approach would be to learn HTML, CSS, and JS, and then work on building a portfolio with those things while searching for a font-end job.  Now I'm in the back-end and thinking about servers and whatnot.  It's really different from how I thought things were going to go when I first started front-end development a few months ago.  I think I'm going to be putting the back-end stuff on hold very soon and instead work on honing my front-end skills and learning the ins-and-outs of vanilla JS.", "id": "e53jff4", "replies": [{"body": "The point of the post is not to be like everyone else and tell you specifically what to learn. The entire point of the post was an effort to have you look for real jobs that are applicable to you, in addition to encouraging you to figure out the things you should learn from those job descriptions.\n\nIMO building a portfolio using HTML, JS, and CSS is fine. My style of doing things is to just get it done. Improve incrementally. Use Github Pages. If you wanna be fancy, hookup a custom domain name to it. Learning the ins and outs of the front end tech as you mentioned is just fine. If you wanna look into deploying non backend involved code, you can push to Heroku.\n\nAs a back end developer I'm involved with things like setting up servers and other parts of a product that are infrastructure involved, but I also know enough about the front end and deployment for debugging purposes etc. I develop code that interfaces with the front end, so knowing the bigger picture helps. I don't see anything wrong with a focus on pure front end stuff for now until you feel like expanding your horizons. It's totally find to spend a majority of your time with HTML, CSS, and JS.\n\nI recommend you join the discord, and I'm not just saying it. I helped a front end dev get a job in 3 months. Join the discord and talk to him and other people as much as you'd like. You can discuss things with people who are on the same journey as you are, and a little farther ahead.\n\nEdit: words", "id": "e53q1dr", "replies": []}]}], "title": "The Most Effective Advice I\u2019ve Given on What to Learn"}
