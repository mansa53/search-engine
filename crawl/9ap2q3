In the interest of honesty, this is a homework question. I am not asking for anyone to do it for me, just asking for some help.\n\nSo here is the exact problem I have been given. I am creating a class and this is one of the methods that is in it. \n\nWithin the CustomerArray class, create a method named loadArray() that accepts\na single String as a parameter representing the path of a file to load. The method\nshould be public and it will return true if everything worked correctly and return\nfalse if something fails. When called, the method should load the file based on the\nparameter passed to this method. Each line should represent a new entry into the\ncustomers array. Each line will be represented as follows with each field delimited\nby commas:\n\nname,email,number\n\n\nNow what I am trying but doesnt seem to be quite right , nor is it finished but..... \n\npublic boolean loadArray(String str){\n         boolean result = false;\n         BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(str+ \".txt\"));\n         String line;\n         while(line = br.readline()!+null){\n         br.useDelimiter(\",\");\n\n\nNow I am not sure how to load that line into the array. My thoughts were to create an int i and after every loop i++. So my last line of code would be \n\n        customers[i] = br.useDelimiter(\",\");\n        i++;\n       return true;\n\nThoughts? Ideas? Way of base?\n         \n\n", "score": 3, "comments": [{"body": "Read the line with `.readLine()` but do not play with the delimiter.\n\nThen, `.split` the read string by `\",\"` and process the resulting array.", "id": "e4wzqge", "replies": []}], "title": "delimit and loading arrays help"}
