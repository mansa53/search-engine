So I\u2019ve been in retail & management for the last 8 years for a major cellphone company. However, Im getting tired of the retail environment and I\u2019m looking to transition into a career in software development that pays more and allows me to have a much more open schedule. I\u2019m real good with computers and the idea of working, de-bugging, and repairing our sales system apps sound more appealing to me then helping a customer troubleshoot their phone. \n\nOn my internal site, I see some of the requirements for a Software Engineer include being able to develop in React Native/React JS, iOS Swift, Bootstrap, and Android; using Spring Model View Controllers (MVC, whatever the hell that is lol); dealing with shortened release cycles & continuous integration; and using code version tools like Git or SVN.\n\nThe only experience I have is a handful of freecodecamp exercises here and there in HTML/CSS and some Udacity intro courses. \n\nI know I\u2019d have a lot of work to do. Any tips on best plan of approach? Thanks in advance. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/", "id": "e547xle", "replies": []}], "title": "Career Switch into Software Engineering?"}
