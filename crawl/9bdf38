It's not far off the mark, either.\n\nBut I do know about certain topics rather well. For instance, if you pick up Learning Python and work through the whole book - you  will feel that you know the Python language very well. You might not know the Python stdlib very well, you might have no idea what HTTP is, you might be a terrible programmer, but you will know the Python language.\n\nFocus on topics of interest to you. It takes a long time to build up a knowledge base. There are no shortcuts, even 4 year degrees only prepares people for an entry level job.\n\n\n", "id": "e528swg", "replies": []}, {"body": "That's called impostor syndrome, it's one of the most prevalent syndromes in our industry.

It was a 10 week internship when there were several other internships that were 15 week and had already begun. I got there and all these interns were already 5 weeks in and in the middle of projects and I felt so insecure.\n\nThen I realized that everyone is pretty much faking it until they make it. I ended up being fine, if not one of the more comfortable with programming. And all of us were leagues ahead of what the employer was expecting, too, lol.\n\nYou just have to get some experience.", "id": "e528enc", "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "> I have been programming for over a year and feel like I know nothing.\n\nCompared to what?
