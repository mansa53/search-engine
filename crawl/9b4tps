I know very basic HTML and CSS, but kind of want to solidify those basics before moving onto what I really want to learn which is C#. My thought is to complete Codecademy\u2019s following courses\n\n- Learn HTML\n- Learn CSS\n- Make a Website\n- Learn Responsive Design\n- Deploy a Website\n\nSome reddit threads online suggested this to someone else, as it \u201chelps get you in the right mindset\u201d while teaching you basic things about very popular languages. Which is especially useful if you want to learn more about web development later on.\n\nMy question is if this is a good idea for me. I just don\u2019t want to waste 20 or so hours on codecademy if their courses aren\u2019t all that great.\n\nThanks in advance", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Nah, head straight into C#", "id": "e50flex", "replies": [{"body": "Is there a reason you say that?
