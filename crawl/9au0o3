{"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9au0o3/got_the_job_today_for_a_mid_senior_level_but_i_am/", "text": "TLDR at the end.\n\nI will start as a software test engineer in a company that has been developing a mobile application. My responsibilities will mostly be writing test cases and scripts for our platform and doing automation tests for android and ios devices. I am also gonna be responsible to do load test as the application has reached 1 million downloads and almost 400k users are using the app at the same time. I wanted to be accepted so badly and i am kinda happy that they chose me for the position.\n\nSounds good right? Well, there is a very huge problem. I think I'm too inexperienced for this position. I am going to be the first tester in the company and this scares me a lot. There isn't any other junior or senior test engineer, all the other employees are developers. It is a mid senior position and i don't fell like i'm a mid senior, actually i don't even feel like a junior right now. Previously i had worked as a Software QA engineer in a company for only 3 months and learnt some basic skills in software QA like test automation using selenium (python 2.6), manual testing etc. But all the other testers were way more experienced than me, and I was not able to make any real contribution to the team, and as a result my team leader said i am too incompetent and reluctant for this position. Yes i was incompetent and reluctant. My salary was very low and I was expected to work overtime and even on weekends. Eventually, I got laid off from the job.\n\nThe person who made the interview, called me today to inform that i got the job. He said \"there were people who had better technical skills than you but you seemed the most enthusiastic and therefore I chose you.\" Yeah great, I am flattered.\n\nBut how about hiring a senior test engineer?\n\nWhere am i suppose to start? I dont know.\n\nHe said we're gonna use Appium. Ok great. I downloaded Appium. But i dont know how to proceed. I dont know the correct configurations. I dont even know the suitable operating system. I used linux mint before. But i mostly use Windows.\n\nAll in all, I feel like an ant that is left in the middle of the ocean and trying to find its way. I do not know where to start and how to proceed. I have been unemployed for 3.5 months and I assumed my life was over when i got fired. Now, I'll be paid almost twice as much salary than the previous one, and I will not have to do that much work, a job that I can learn more in a less stressful environment with doing less overtime. Definitely don't wanna miss this opportunity like the previous one.. For this reason, I wanted to share my concern with you here and would like to listen to your recommendations. Any advise or guidance would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\u200b\n\nTL,DR: Accepted to a mid senior software test engineering position. I am very very inexperienced, no senior engineer to guide me, and am expected to write test scripts from scratch using Appium, selenium web driver, juint etc.", "score": 3, "comments": [{"body": "In most cases, they (the company ) understand your situation/experience and has agreed to work with you.\n\nHopefully you\u2019ve noted to them that this technology is something you don\u2019t have experience in and that it may take some time. \n\nLook for tutorials and official documentations for said technology.\n\nIt won\u2019t hurt to ask if any developers has previously tried to setup the testing framework or any initial setups on an existing branch. \n\nDon\u2019t be too hard on yourself. \nKeep learning and hopefully they\u2019ll give you time to acclimate. \n\n", "id": "e4y8mdk", "replies": []}, {"body": "> The person who made the interview, called me today to inform that i got the job.

You are not going to be expected to build the testing on the first day.\n\n> Where am i suppose to start? I dont know.\n\nTalk to the engineers who are writing the software and find out what they think are metrics that the software should be meeting.  Talk to management and find out from them what they expect from the software.  Find out who the important stakeholders are and find out what they are looking for.\n\nThen work on measuring what the software is actually doing against expectations.", "id": "e4ydpbr", "replies": []}], "title": "Got the job today for a mid senior level.
