What I am trying to achieve is to parse the JSON (I'm using 'request' for that), and find and extract the 'discount' information of a specific item (identified by its product description).\nFor instance on this page, I want to find the product \"\"Gar\u00adden Gour\u00admet Fala\u00adfel\" and in the same object, extract the values of the \"discount\" sub-object.\n\nI have googled and tried plenty of solutions found on stack overflow / github, and have not managed to make it work : functions iterating through the object, the \"traverse\" npm package, defiantJS... I have not succeeded to make any of these methods work. \n\nThe JSON path is not always the same for all items (and like here, sometimes lists data for several products on the same page), so I cannot simply hardcode the path. I want to be able to find the product description, and extract the discount object linked to that product.\n\n\nIf anyone knows how this can be done, it would be really helpful as I am out of things to try.\n\nThank you", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Have you tried Object.keys(yourObject)?

If so, then you can hardcode all the variations and try them one by one.\n\nIf the 'discount' part is always the same, you can even go for the more crude approach of treating the JSON as a string and just searching it for the word 'discount'. This is of course less reliable, but if you have a decent idea of what the data is going to contain, you can get away with it.", "id": "e4vgv2d", "replies": []}], "title": "[JS] How can I search for a specific key through this complex JSON ?"}
