I like it, but it starting to feel old and sometimes additional components are old or hard to find.\n* WPF: i've worked with WPF a little, and while I've liked the XAML editor, again I felt there was even less additional components to import.\n* UWP: never used it, but I've discarded it because it have features I don't need (like mobile or xbox support) and it requires Win10, requirement I don't want to enforce.\n\nAs you already guessed, I'm a C# developer, so I started from that.\nI also worked on Electron, and while I enjoy the deep graphic customization, I'm not fluent with it and I don't trust it when I need to work with USB devices or more low level things.\n\nAre the frameworks I've listed still valid? \nWhich are the other choices?\n\nThanks a lot.", "score": 5, "comments": [{"body": "I would personally ditch WinForms and focus on WPF and UWP (UWP is essentially just a more modern WPF with more async etc, so skills transfer well).\n\nThat said there's cross-platform frameworks such as Qt or web-apps in ASP.NET Core", "id": "e5345eq", "replies": [{"body": "I loved ASP.NET Core, I felt it was a great improvement from the \"old\" ASP.NET.", "id": "e539ya0", "replies": [{"body": "Did you use Razor pages?

You don't *have* to deploy your app to an xbox if you don't want.\n\nUWP is the \"modern\" Windows framework.
