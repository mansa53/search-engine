Here is the story.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI want to make a site of a \"Captains Mode\" and \"Captains Draft\" of Dota2 to play with myself, because there is no other way to do it, Open 2 steams not work anymore, there was a site called Dota2Draft that is offline, the guy that created the website have the source code (will post here in the end), but i dont wanna use it because you needed to open 2 tabs of the website to use.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo is there any language that is easy to learn and help me?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSource code: https://github.com/Philaeux/dota2draft  \nExample of what i want: https://gaming-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/dota-2-draft-captains-draft-523x386.jpg\n", "score": 3, "comments": [{"body": "The way this looks like, this is some pretty specific behavior you want to achieve.
