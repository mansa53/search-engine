I have been having issues visualizing a few aspects though, so for reference I've been using some graphics that I found in a few corners of the internet, but none of them are exactly stellar or give the clearest picture. I'm curious if there are any gems I've missed.", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "If you\u2019re talking about RAMs: Draw a RAM! Basically a long rectangle with sections.
