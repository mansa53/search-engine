P1 has a 3 GHz clock rate and a CPI of 1.25. P2 has a 2.5 GHz clock rate and a CPI of 1.0. \n\n Which processor has the highest performance expressed in instructions per second? *Show the equations you used.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was given a couple equations. Most notably, \n\nExecution Time = # instructions \\* CPI \\* Clock Period\n\nBasically, I had to look to another section to figure out that if I wanted to get \"instructions per second\",\n\nI needed to use Clock Rate/ CPI .\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I eventually get two answers that I can compare to each other. Is the highest IPS the faster processor? Is instruction set the same as # of instructions? Just because one IPS is higher than the other doesn't mean it's faster right? \n\n ", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Instruction sets are the set of instructions a processor can compute. For example ADD, MOV, etc. Some instruction sets have instructions that take more than a single cycle to complete. By saying that the instruction sets are the same, they are saying that this does not come into the equation.\n\n\nIf instructions per second is higher that means that the number of instruction a processor can compute in a given time is faster than another processor with a lower IPS.", "id": "e5aj0cq", "replies": []}], "title": "[Homework] A relatively simple architecture question"}
