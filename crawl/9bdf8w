Is it possible to learn C++ this fall/winter and then learn Java over a couple weeks before the Spring Semester, or should I try to learn both simultaneously? For C++ I am using the C++ Primer book and for Java I was going to do the Helsinki classes.", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "I'd say learn the C++.\n\nModern (>=cx11) has smart pointers and unique pointers, if you can use those then the only thing you need to learn about java is that everything is a reference and in essence a smart pointer that gets garbage collected automatically.\n\nBesides the syntax changes which can be learnt within 2 days there is the stdlib which somewhat resembles STL through generics. You should be able to follow along without many issues.", "id": "e526o5c", "replies": []}], "title": "Learn Java after C++ or simultaneously?"}
