Should i do that on WordPress or a site like this? Or build it from scratch. I d like to also make an app, for the same purpose of \"just making it\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know HTML and CSS, a bit of java aswell as javascript, and wanna develop online sites for small companys (just for free, as projects) after i finished this one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for your help.", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": ">and i wanna make a website where she can sell it aswell as an app\n\nShe's probably better off just using Etsy or something similar. Or you can use a site-builder for an e-commerce site. \n\nThe fact is, E-Commerce is a solved problem. All you can really do by developing your own e-commerce site is to introduce risk that doesn't exist with using the existing platforms. Risk of storing private information, risk of processing your own payments, risk of hosting and managing a site if you're not familiar with it...\n\nThere are lots of great learner projects out there. Not sure a real-life e-commerce site is the best one of them.", "id": "e53pyr2", "replies": [{"body": "Ok thank you for your advice.
