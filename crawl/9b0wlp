Use version control git to get used to working with others\n2. Practice leading team on a project to completion \n\nSo where do you find people to code with? Are there online communities you can go to to find people? Ill be going to a local meet up this weekend and maybe will meet some people there as well.\n\nI know that i could and should be looking out for open source projects to contribute to already, and i am going to do that as well.", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Well, it's sort of hard to find people like that.\n\nWhat you could do is work solo on a git project with a remote repo. Clone 2 versions of it locally, and work on 2 separate features and then attempt to deal with the merge, PRs, etc. Learn a git work flow as well. Atlassian has a solid write up [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows).\n\nSorry, this isn't really what you're looking for, but it sorta simulates what you wanna learn.

Ive been trying to replicate conflicting merge requests and such, but never thought to just have 2 separate repos contributing. Thanks for the idea. It will atleast help me get better with git.
