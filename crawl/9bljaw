It was a relatively new course so I thought I'd give it a shot (auditing it, not paying for the cert) and try to learn something new. \n\nDisclaimer: I'm fairly familiar with Unix (I use Solus as my daily OS) but I'm fairly novice when it comes to terminal usage.\n\nGenerally, I thought that class gave a really good overview of the basics. If anyone wants to learn more about using the terminal to become more effective with whatever they're doing I'd say this is a good place to start.\n\nSome of the commands it covers in include: ls, cd, mv, mkdir, touch, md5sum, grep, and egrep. It also covered the basics of bash programming: variables, loops, functions, etc.\n\nPersonally the two most useful things I learned were the apropos command and the basics of makefiles.\n\nHeads up for anyone thinking of checking it out, it doesn't really have any videos with useful content. All of the commands and materials are just written in text. The videos just give a short overview of each \"week\" (which would probably take you around ~1 hour).\n\nTL;DR: Good overview of unix commands, but all text based. I recommend giving it an \"audit\" for free if you're interested.", "score": 2, "comments": [], "title": "Review of The Unix Workbench - A class work taking a peek at"}
