Each category has a variable number of criteria that apply. I needed a way to search all categories easily and quickly, and then display all relevant criteria only. This works great in Excel, but it's going to get bigger and more complicated, and I'd like to move it to a faster and more flexible user interface that i can easily deploy inside our business.\n\nIs there a particular language that would be easier to get approval to run in our environment? It's a financial services company. We run on WinTerms, so it's a remote session. Does anyone have any recommendations, thoughts or experience to share?\n\n[Disclaimer: I am not a programmer. I am in a small team in customer service, helping develop a new product. As the knowledge required is incredibly deep and difficult to teach, I am trying to build systems to make looking up the correct information intuitive and fast. I do have some experience with basic programming, and i'm prepared to self learn whatever language I need to build this in]", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "So is your concern the user interface or the amount of data and complexity might be too much for excel. Especially if it is important data you should probably use a database which is a little more robust and allows fine-grained user permissions. You might for example use SQL as a database query language together with databases such as mysql, mariadb, postgresql...\nIf it\u2018s really mission-critical you should probably rather hire a professional, there\u2018s only so much you can teach yourself in limited time.", "id": "e5cfgzw", "replies": [{"body": "The main concern is the user interface. I am already seeing some slowing down, and other odd behaviour when I have multiple spreadsheets open. Security only needs two levels, user and admin. I would prefer to keep the actual data in a spreadsheet, to make it easier to update (in fact, it's critical that it is easy to update immediately and often, and the person/people making those edits will have limited skill in excel, and no other technical skills).\n\nThe fast and easy to use/read front end is the thing I would like to build myself. It's relatively straightforward, it's just a lookup, which returns 2 columns of questions and answers.\n\nMy question is really around what should I do to make it easy to deploy. I might have to leave it in VBA just because that's already on everyone's machine, it's just that VBA is a real bastard and really slow. Also everyone has multiple spreadsheets open already so it causes problems because Excel is all one program instance.\n", "id": "e5ch0lf", "replies": []}]}], "title": "Best language to write user interface in, to deploy in a typical corporate IT environment."}
