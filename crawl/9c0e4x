I know a lot of people that their jobs are to just code, and I know some \"extreme versions\" of these people that are able to be massively productive and code most of the day. No, I don't mean going without sleep, no, I don't mean not eating, and no, I don't mean doing anything to the point where you are unhealthy. **What I meant by my question is what tips do you extremely productive coders out there have for being extremely productive while being healthy?** Specifically, how do you code in long intervals? Obviously you can't code a lot if you're not taking care of yourself.

Are you asking:\n\n* what is the motivation behind coding day and night, or\n* what are the means they people use to code days and night.\n\nThere are 2 things, you need to understand why people are coding day and night. Based on my experience\n\n* Some people have passion of coding and algorithm. They try to find complex algorithm problems on various competition websites such as topcoder etc. There are 2 motives behind it, first is to shine in the coding world and be on the top of the ranking, or to practice and find a good job in best companies.\n* There is another set who code and innovate. These people want to learn a new language or they have seen a problem that could be solved using their skills.

After some years I now barely check Facebook and I don't watch any news. \n- Start your day with something small to get momentum, if you have priority tasks in your projects some times you need to force you to start working o particular task that is not very interesting to you, so if you are not sure where to start just do something small, like opening your editor and read the code related to the task or creating very basic HTML if it's a new feature.\n- If you are just starting to code focus on one part of the stack only or library, there's just so many things to learn that you can easily get overwhelmed. \n- Invest in a nice pair of headphones with noise cancelling. To get into the zone I like to listen to music, there's a good playlist in Spotify called \"Deep Focus\". That works most of the time for me. \n- Early mornings are great to get things done. I used to code late at night and wake up a little late, I'm not saying it doesn't work, but you will be amazed if you start waking up early, you brain is fully rested and ready to fix that bug you couldn't fix the day before.\n- Take care of your back and neck, if you plan to code all day get the best ergonomic chair you can and don't work on the bed if you work remotely. I've been working from home for 7+ years and I got a neck herniated disc for working on the bed for long periods of time. Also a standing desk could work (I haven't tried). I try to do little walks around my apartment to help my back get some rest and this also gives me time to think on the task I'm working on.       \n ", "id": "e57fjoz", "replies": []}, {"body": "I currently work full time as a web developer where 99% of my day is spent on coding. I am extremely productive in the hours that I code, but I never work more than 7 hours a day. This actually helps me, because I don't get a long dreading feeling while at work and it really helps me avoid burnout. I also don't have any social media accounts other than Reddit which I really don't use much. This helps me stay focused when I need to get shit done. In my 7 hours I can get done more than what most people can do in a 9 hour day, because I am able to stay focused on the task at hand.\n\nMy best advice is to minimize distractions such as meetings, email, social media, etc, and just go at it for a long block of time. You will be surprised how productive you can be. I would recommend reading the book Deep Work by Cal Newport. It explains in detail how to go about achieving this level of productivity without overworking yourself.\n\nI also use these same techniques to avoid burnout while working on my YouTube channel about teaching web development, because that channel takes a lot of my time after work each day and is very similar to what I do at work.", "id": "e57hc9o", "replies": [{"body": "I also have a YouTube channel about Web Development/Devops (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnFRgYETwUg6eoeHACuVkcA), would you be interested in reviewing it and I will review yours?", "id": "e58zqk6", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "As to the staying healthy part of the question - I suggest you have an activity you like to do that relaxes the mind.
