{"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9c7qbo/should_i_take_intro_to_cs_or_intro_to_c_first/", "text": "So I am debating on which course I should take first to progress in the topic of Computer Science. I have narrowed it down to either:\n\nCS50's Introduction to Computer Science - https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x\n\nor:\n\nIntroduction to C++ - https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-c-0\n\nCurrently I only know JavaScript and have been practicing it for about a year. I feel I am pretty knowledgeable with the language and can build full complex web applications with it.\n\nHowever, I feel the knowledge I have is only scraping the tip of the iceberg when it comes to CS. I am still very weak with topics such as Data Structures and Algorithms. When I hear of stuff like Hash Tables, Heaps and Linked Lists; Then I am not familiar with these terms.\n\nSo I was wondering if someone can point me in the right direction. I will eventually take both of these courses but wanted someones opinion on which course should be taken first. Should I learn C++ and then take the Intro the CS or the other way around? Any help would be appreciated.
