To resolve this, install the SDK or Targeting Pack for this framework version or retarget your application to a version of the framework for which you have the SDK or Targeting Pack installed. Note that assemblies will be resolved from the Global Assembly Cache (GAC) and will be used in place of reference assemblies. Therefore your assembly may not be correctly targeted for the framework you intend.\n\n\nSo I go to download the installer for the 4.7 SDK but there is an issue... apparently I already have it? It says that I already have v4.7 or higher installed.\n\nSo I go and look under this folder (that I assume the IDE is looking under): C:\\Program Files\\Reference Assemblies\\Microsoft\\Framework\n\nI find two folders: (1) v3.0 (2) v3.5. NOT 4.7 or higher.\n\nSo what is going on here? And how can I hook this up into my rider IDE in a better way?", "score": 1, "comments": [], "title": "[.Net] Where can I find the reference assemblies for .net v4.7 or higher?
