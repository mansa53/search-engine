I was wondering whether anyone had a good online course/resource they could recommend for someone who already has some experience.\n\nI've taken two programming subjects. The first taught the basics, e.g. control statements, functions, data structures in C. The second was about computer systems, I learnt stuff like MIPS assembly, virtual memory, concurrency, UNIX file system, the basics of networks.\n\nRight now I'm pretty interested in machine learning. I was thinking about doing a coursera specialty. In the meantime, I've been doing the codecademy web development path. Any advice is much appreciated.\n\nThank you.", "score": 5, "comments": [{"body": "Cousera - Algorithms 1 & 2 - Princeton University - Robert...", "id": "e4uxqeh", "replies": [{"body": "Thank you.", "id": "e4v7i7m", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "For web development I\u2019ve been doing \u201cThe Web Developer Bootcamp\u201d by Colt Steele on Udemy.com.
