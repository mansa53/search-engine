So, I'm in a little bit of a bind with regard to my recent Web Development class. Allegedly we're only using HTML to build the website, discouraged from CSS(Unconfirmed), and it has been confirmed we are not to do any kind of backend work on our website. I have much more experience with SQL, using it to build backend environments for friends and for fun. I've never worked in a purely frontend environment from scratch with HTML. \n\n\nI genuinely am unaware on how far I can stretch HTML to accomplish my end goal(s). Generally the websites we've been shown look like they're from 2005. Given the constraints I totally get it it takes a fuckton of work to accomplish something with scrolling and moving images without a lot of CSS and/or CMS experience to aid you along. \n\n\nTo do absolutely everything from scratch feels both too simple for something we supposedly can put on our GitHub accounts (when it feels like most everyone else that puts their files on Git has better looking work) and tough for someone who has little experience working in a purely HTML purely front-end environment.

It seems impossible to do a web dev without HTML/CSS and probably JS.\n\n> Generally the websites we've been shown look like they're from 2005\n\nWebsites in 2005 used CSS!

The websites shown as final projects really didn't inspire confidence however, and we aren't allowed to view the source code. Just  by looking at them, I could see there was minimal CSS usage, or poorly executed (even by beginner standards- it's hard to implement I get it but at least make it clean). I've been told that using any kind of CMS as an aid (even if you build the rest of it, so something like Card or what ScottsCheapFlights uses) will get you an automatic F. \n\n\nI need an easy A, and this class might as well be one so long as I can get the basic HTML down... but yeah I really have reservations. I feel like if I use even a basic template you can find online for free that gives me even somewhat of a modern look to the website and optimizes it for mobile devices will get me a failed grade, even if the rest of the site was made by myself.\n\n\n> Websites in 2005 used CSS! Remember Youtube launched in 2005.\n\n\nI am aware that they used CSS, they just didn't use it in the same way it is used now. I'd say that most of them looked like they were made around yeah 2003-2005.", "id": "e521xdo", "replies": [{"body": "It sounds like your prof wants you to learn html and if you want to get an easy A then stick to the rules and do your best.

The class is billed as being a primer in front-end development (WebDev specifically) covering everything from HTML to relevant JS and CSS but uh.. that doesn't seem to be playing out these first couple days + Syllabus.

You could always jump ahead and start learning js and css. They are both much more difficult than html.
