Why does one travel to n - 1 and one to just n with n being the array.length? I know that n - 1 would access the last index but since the outer loop for that option is i < n - 1, then won't it not traverse to the very last element?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for your help!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nloop with n - 1: [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/)\n\nloop with just n: [https://www.javatpoint.com/bubble-sort-in-java](https://www.javatpoint.com/bubble-sort-in-java)", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "The -1 is probs cause it wil take the next element.
