At first, the idea seemed really simple: Making a genetic AI that can go through the Chrome Dinosaur game from Chrome as far as possible without any human interaction. Doesn't sound difficult, right?\n\nWell, my current knowledge is literally just the basics of C++ without even using libraries. I blame it on having a messy teaching schedule that moves from C++ to PHP all the time for no reason. So i decided to search for some information on how i could do it properly, but i can never find a \"decent\" guide on these kinds of things. \n\nEverytime i try to google anything related to programming, it turns into a thin line that only divides the basics of using math to huge lines of coding that would take me hours to decipher. I can never find the middle ground that i'm currently in without making it seem like i'm taking the next step.\n\nI am not looking for a direct answer on what to do nor a full code of a working program that does exactly that. My main difficulty with learning programming is the fact that i can never find a \"stair pattern\" guide that actually shows some progression overall. Thus, i am looking for any form of guidance in which i can learn what i need to do without feeling completely lost. That's pretty much it. \n\nI'm still a student so i don't know much about all programming languages but i'd much rather learn around Python or C#/C++. I have no idea how to make this sound less vague so:\n\n**TL;DR: How can i properly learn how to make a genetic algorithm with an specific function on my own without feeling completely lost?**", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": "There is a channel called coding train.

You are expecting to find a guide that will hold your hand all the way through, but in reality, you need to put in the extra effort to really learn the specifics of what you are trying to learn. There are a ton of guides that will guide you and help you learn. That's it. If you don't understand something, then there is only one way to fix that. It's okay to feel completely lost at first, we all were. Only by gaining experience and working the problem will you learn how something really works.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for the genetic algorithm...there are guides out there that explain how to code it better than I can. If you need any help with it, feel free to ask me questions. I have done a good amount of work with genetic algorithms. Good luck!", "id": "e4yu7ou", "replies": []}, {"body": "> thin line that only divides the basics of using math to huge lines of coding\n\nYou might want to work on intermediately sized problems first. Reading and using a larger piece of code is a good starting point. \n\nFor the dino game, have a look at the code of the actual game (chrome: inspect code, sources, chromedine.com, js). A small-mid sized problem would be to alter the game by changing the rules. Or add a solver that does the required user inputs by using at the internal variables. \n\nOnce you get this done, you could change to the processing the graphics to determine the required inputs. At this point you could use some AI techniques.\n\nA large-mid sized problem would be to rewrite it in C++ using some libraries.\n\n\n", "id": "e4yvj1m", "replies": []}], "title": "Total Newbie decided to make a Genetic Algorithm and has no idea how to get started."}
