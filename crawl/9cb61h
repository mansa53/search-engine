Moreover, the queue to even reach said register is always excruciatingly long and people often end up giving up entirely.\n\nI want to help them create a free, simple platform where people can express their preference (which course they would like to attend during every turn, based on availability) and also their second choices in case their first was overbooked.\n\nDo you have any idea how I could do that? I was thinking google forms but perhaps someone has a better idea...\n\nThank you!\n\n&#x200B;", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "Google forms, Surveymonkey, basically any survey site will do.", "id": "e59dzyc", "replies": [{"body": "Thanks, I'll look into SurveyMonkey too :) ", "id": "e59e1o0", "replies": []}]}], "title": "School web site - Can I do something to help them?"}
