Yesterday I studied part 1 until part 3, and today I studied the part 4 ... So I decided to do something similar, but without looking at the codes of the project of the tutorial, I ended up using only parts of the tutorial to try to mount what I wanted, and other things, I simply forgot how it works, did not know the what to do ... Did you do that too in the beginning? I also had these problems when I started learning Python, I do not know how I am today because I have not stopped to practice the things I have learned. And my head looks like it's going to explode when I'm trying to do something with Django, I have to create views, templates, models,  urls, add the app to Django admin site, create superuser ... and a whole bunch of stuff. I'm afraid I do not have very good memory, because I have a certain attention defict and sometimes I can not focus very well on what I'm doing.", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "Mate that stuff comes with time, the more you do it the more it becomes natural to do. The first time learn anything you remember only bits of it that stick and then slowly the more you do it the more you remember.\n\nYou should work on projects that use the things you learn each time, try it and then try it again. Improve upon it see what projects you can build around something", "id": "e581e7w", "replies": [{"body": "I tried to create a simple project that creates a table with the name of a club, and another one that stores details of that club and relates to an FK. And I wanted to put this in the Django admin site, create templates to retrieve this information in the database etc ... But I simply crashed trying to do that. Maybe practice will help me, but by then, I think I'll have a lot of headaches.", "id": "e581nux", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "If you never build anything then you will forget it all. You only speak of the things you read, not of the things you build, which tells me you don't actually build any programs.\n\nYou cannot learn programming by just reading books. You have to build programs that do things. If you don't do that, you will forget everything. It's like trying to learn playing the guitar by listening to guitar music. You don't learn anything that way.", "id": "e58d7t5", "replies": []}, {"body": "It's perfectly normal.

For example, I was learning Vue some time ago. I built a whole app with it and used quite a bit of it. That was some months ago. If I now needed to use it I would need to open their site to check how it was used, or my app. I don\u2019t remember how it works yet. \n\nAs opposed to things I\u2019ve done multiple times, those I don\u2019t need to check up all the time. But even some of that I do. Our brains can\u2019t contain all the information we need all the time with perfect recollection. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a good thing we have references to check things on. \n\nSo you\u2019ll get there. Nobody learns at the first time and especially not just by reading or watching a video series once. It requires lots of doing.
