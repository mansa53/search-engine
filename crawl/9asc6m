Also I have an older version of Xcode and I haven't been able to update it because it says that I need to install a more recent Mac OS and the High Sierra installation keeps failing every time.

You can still use VS Code to edit your programs - just open a terminal in your source code and:\n\n+ `$ g++ my_program.cpp -o my_program` to compile the program\n+ `$ ./my_program` to run the program\n\nGoing this route is really easy, and you are going to spend a lot less time wrestling with the IDE.
