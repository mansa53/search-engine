I read other people's solution just fine but I cannot understand their reasoning behind it. I feel like I am walking in circles and that I actually have not progressed as much as I thought. How do I recognize when a problem is best solved with a DP approach? How do I figure out the overlapping elements in the problem? How do I know how to break it into subproblems? When to use top-down vs bottom-up approach?", "score": 1, "comments": [], "title": "Is there any free online resources that teaches people, step by step, how to recognize and break down a dynamic programming problem?"}
