I downloaded and installed the Jupyter notebook with the Anaconda package which includes some IDE\u2019s and other tools I\u2019m not experienced enough to understand. But because my laptop isn\u2019t particularly powerful, I felt the anaconda package slowed it down. I\u2019ve tried book pdf\u2019s where they give instructions on what to install and download but have experienced trouble installing everything before I can even utilize the OpenCV Library. My question, more specifically, is what is an easy way that I can install and use OpenCV ? Is there a specific book you found useful? What IDE or text editor did you use?

Installing OpenCV in vanilla Python is more involved but plenty of people have explained it in-depth before.  If you've got a specific issue then ask about that.\n\n[There's plenty of OpenCV tutorials aimed at Python](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html).  For more advanced features you may have to look at examples in C/C++ and adapt them for Python; thankfully the OpenCV API is similar across different languages.", "id": "e5b2xf1", "replies": [{"body": "If I used anaconda, do you recommend a specific application within the package to develop code?
