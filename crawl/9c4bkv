Given approximately 3 weeks or so, I can nail the concept of any programming-related tools (library, framework, language). I like to call it \"tolerably bad\".\n\nThen I read about this collection of smart automation algorithms that people refer as AI and now I want to \"invent\" things too. I have long list of what I wish I could build (DSP related problem; specifically about audio manipulation) for years but its next to impossible to code in any language in conventional manner.\n\nI know all the buzzwords and been actively trying to get in (*Deep Learning in Python by Fran\u00e7ois Chollet* is one god-sent resource). I assume this might takes 2 months or so to get the big picture.\n\nI guess writing softwares brings food to the table but I'm afraid being a young CS undergrad, in the next 10-20 years, AI is becoming the new standard; a must have in any modern software. Hence, if I shy away from learning AI, I will become obsolete soon or later. Reverse that and I'll die starving.\n\nAs senior developer or AI researcher, what do you say about this?\n\n*(Sorry for grammar mistakes.

All I want is to make sure I have enough money to sustain myself and time to work on things that I love doing.\n\n>You're not going to starve if you're writing software lol.\n\nI guess I worded my post badly. What I meant was, when knowledge in applied AI is common among developer, it would be hard for me to get a job if I \\*\\*only\\*\\* know conventional programming.\n\n>Be good at what you do, don't be a dick, and you'll have a job. No one can see the future.\n\nGreat advice. Though I'm not really good at anything other than working with computer, sadly :/ I chose this major with this thing in mind ~~only to find team management is a lot more important than code, ugh!~~.\n\n>I promise you, AI/Machine Learning is *far* **far** more advanced than simply \"inventing things\". It's so math heavy and research heavy that your average programmer just won't be able to keep up.\n\nAs far as I know, what you refer to is AI research. What I plan to do (for now) is only applied AI; using existing model like LSTM and GANs to do crazy audio-ish stuff (notice the double quote on inventing on my post).\n\nTo be honest, I think learning math sucks less than learning programming tools. Learn complex number and I can use it for DSP and AI. Learn Django and when you decided to stop using it, its just, you know, gone. For good. Nothing is reusable other than mental block to understand how other similar tools work.\n\nAfter all, thanks for replying. It seems like I still have naive POV in real world scenario. I guess I'm worrying too much.", "id": "e583m0w", "replies": []}]}], "title": "Where should I go from here?"}
