I can't simply download every image by modifying the same URL since the URL includes a more or less random timestamp for each image that I cannot guess without downloading the image first. However, that website also has a download button, you click it and it opens the image URL.\n\nI took a look at the source code for the button itself, here's what I found out: \n\n* There's some kind of variable in the URL for the date the photo was taken. Since there's an image for every day and I want to download all of them, that's not a problem.\n* The source code includes the actual direct download link to that image for the date entered in the URL, that link is mostly the same but includes a different timestamp at the end, so it's easily searchable.\n\n\nHere's what I'm doing to manually download these images:\n\n1. Open the direct link to the download button, insert the date I want\n2. Let firefox display the source code\n3. Ctrl+F a string that is known to me, that leads to the complete URL for the picture\n4. Open that URL in a new tab\n5. Download the image\n\nSo that's what I'm going to make python do:\n\n1. Insert the date into the direct link to the download button\n2. Download the source code for that button\n3. Search the source code, return the string it found\n4. Have another function actually download the image\n\nIs that even a good idea? Is there something you would do different?", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "There are libraries for parsing and searching the DOM.
