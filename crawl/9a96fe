Like, no matter how much I read or watch something the logic doesn't click for me.  I was wondering if anyone else has this happen to them?  Is this normal?\n\nBackground : I've been a developer for about 2 years now (the end of this year will be my second) I've been a swift developer for some time and while I've built out features for apps I feel like I'm bad at solving logic problems or breaking down a larger problem down into manageable ones.\n\nThere are days where I look at some of my code and I don't understand how it works.  I want to get better and improve, but I don't know where to start or how to go about doing so.  I'm taking a CS1 class right now, and I'm committed to it but I already feel overwhelmed on our first project.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "I do, and you'll get better at it!
