I have enjoyed using the flow chart based code system found in these programs. \n\nI have a growing fascination with [Emergent systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HI8FerKr6Q&t=78s) I believe these have been generated through \"Computational growth processes\" \n\nI was wondering if anyone has any suggestions on how to get started in this kind of field or what language to look at.\n\nThanks for reading.", "score": 1, "comments": [], "title": "Learning to code for Generative Design, and Emergent Design"}
