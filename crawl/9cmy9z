But when it comes to learning from real source code and figuring out what it all means and how it works, I am clueless. I don't believe it's a problem of not knowing the language. (I currently know C and Java.) I am not sure what I need to do to understand real code. For example, I am currently trying to figure out how to program a Forwarder Channel on my Wii, but the only source code I could find (from USB Loader GX) seems convoluted and I don't understand many of the arguments used in various functions or the structs and enums used, despite me knowing what structs and enums are in general. **So for experienced programmers, what is some advice you can give for how to dissect and actually understand code from real projects that serve a purpose?**", "score": 3, "comments": [{"body": "If it's not documented good luck.. \n\nIt's really just about being able to read code and follow it.

First check documentation and comments. There are none?  Go to the developer and ask them directly what something does. Can\u2019t speak with the developer?  Start putting in break points and logging out part of the code to see what is being returned and try to dissect what you can from the results. That isn\u2019t working?
