My issue is (beyond being terrible at JS), I want the sections to start inactive.

That is slightly simpler, but I'm still unsure of how to start the lists as set to off when the page loads, unless I'm missing something in your explanation.\n\nThis is what the code looks like now:\n\n    <script>\n                function myFunction() {\n                    var x = document.getElementById(\"Team\");\n                    if (x.style.display === \"block\") {\n                        x.style.display = \"none\";\n                    } else {\n                        x.style.display = \"block\";\n                    }\n                }\n            </script>\n\n\u200bEdit: Actually I remember why I didn't do this initially. I have multiple buttons and content blocks. In my initial snippet I am still able to collapse each content block on it's own. That doesn't seem to work in this simplified version.
