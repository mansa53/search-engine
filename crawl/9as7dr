My problem is I'd always learn the basics then get stuck. What do I do? How? It feels like I get stuck in a cycle of basics and can't break free. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few examples to illustrate\n\n* After taking an interest in programming  after years of not doing anything, I looked up an algorithm course but then the algorithm course was using dictionaries at week 2 or so. I thought: Damn let's go learn that again. Then I ended up downloading lots of videos on the entire language.  And thus re-starting everything. \n* I was thinking of trying out a business idea and then I downloaded an HTML course to learn it all over again. I absorbed the front end material and made a mock site, but never touched HTML again.  I didn't know what else to do as far as I was concerned I did what I wanted. \n\nI never know what to do improve. People make suggestions but for the most part I find those projects/Ideas boring.  The one thing I can say, is that when I need to learn something I can. My favorite part is looking up parts of the documentation and seeing what I didn't know and then using it. However then I realize there is more that I don't know and end up in that cycle of learning everything once again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy ultimate goal is to be competent and able to join open source projects and be useful.  Hopefully my post made some sense and you can advise how to break of the cycle and improve. Maybe it's something to do with discipline?  I don't mind sitting down for 4 hours to figure out how to align a button and a carousel but I can't take the time out to do daily programming challenges. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy current interests now are cyber security and ML. I am looking at a few books to get but I keep wondering if I will fall into the cycle of basics again after a chapter or 2. ", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "It's kind of related to discipline. You should probably realize that you don't need to learn ALL of HTML to build a site, or ALL of algorithms to code some solution to a problem, or ALL of ML to implement some logistic regression model. \n\nFind a problem you are interested in and work through it. Learn what you need to. A really fantastic tip I've been fond of is to do 10 or 15 day micro-projects. When you are time limited to a max of 2 weeks you have to focus on viability (MVP = minimally viable product) and produce something of value. It'll be shit but it'll work. A finished project is infinitely better than the perfect start to something left rusting in the attic. ", "id": "e4xqbge", "replies": [{"body": "I know that. Any tips on how I can improve my discipline?\n\nAnd that's an amazing idea. I never thought of that. Thank you so much.", "id": "e4xqmxw", "replies": [{"body": "Overall discipline is difficult to cultivate. It's like muscle that atrophies or strengthens depending on how much you use it. Practice it in other aspects of your life. Don't hit the snooze button, finish your workout, focus on what you're doing whether it's hanging with friends or doing homework, blah blah.

Set attainable goals and focus on each step being a success. Don\u2019t think about the finish line at 26.2 miles, think about how awesome it will be to pass mile 1. Then mile 2. Then mile 5.
