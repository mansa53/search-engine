I'm having problems removing the spaces from a string and passing it onto another string. This is the code i have so far. I feel it should work but it isn't returning anything. So far i have only written half the code which would return the string without spaces.\n\n\u200bPicture 1:\n\n[http://www.mediafire.com/view/1dd0nh40bos3nc1/pic%201.PNG](http://www.mediafire.com/view/1dd0nh40bos3nc1/pic%201.PNG)\n\n&#x200B;\n\npicture 2:\n\n[http://www.mediafire.com/view/o9h1yji44sn16ub/pic%202.PNG](http://www.mediafire.com/view/o9h1yji44sn16ub/pic%202.PNG)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u200b\n\nthank you so much for your help.", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "To all following commenters: please, do not bring up the old circlejerk \njokes/memes about recursion (\"Understanding recursion...\", \"This is \nrecursion...\", etc.).
