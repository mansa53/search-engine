I can only find decent reviews from 2017 and backwards, except from their own sources of course. I am thinking of switching careers in a few years to the programming side of jobs instead of manual labor. The cost of it I am ok with, if it provides me anything remotly good.\n\nAre the curriculum decent designed? I think their approach to \"slow learning\" & learning the fundamentals of programming instead of just the new fancy frameworks is a reasonable idea. What to you guys think of their learning approach?\n\nIs it a waste of time? Is there any other alternatives online 'bootcamps' that are to consider?  \n\n\n/Loweryourbar", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "Colt Steele's Web Developer course\nModern React and Redux with Stephen Grider \nJavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts \n\nThese udemy courses plus other resources like FreeCodeCamp are a solid package, plus you won't have to take on unnecessary debt.  \n\nSelf-teaching requires discipline, but it's very much doable and is less expensive than a camp. Not to mention, it's self-paced for better or worse. \n\nI can't speak for launch school, personally, but if you like a structured curriculum where someone can hold your hand where need be, it might be worth investigating.
