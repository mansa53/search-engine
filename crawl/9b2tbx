I'm learning from it and progressing through (about 4 chapters in).  People also seem to reference this book often as one of the better learning sources for C++.\n\n/rant\n\nThe part that bothers me is the exercises at the end of the chapters.  Maybe it's just been too long since I have worked through a programming book, but the some of the exercises make use of code not yet seen at this point in the book, and the example answers on the website make references to code that doesn't even appear until later in the book.  Example from one of the exercise answers:\n\n>/*\n>\tAn apology: To use cin again after a failed read, you need to use a function call \"cin.clear();\" to \"clear\" it.\n>\tThat isn't explained in the book until chapter 10. Sorry.\n\n>\tSolutions that do not use this technique can get very complicated.\n>*/\n\nThis is in the example solution in Chapter 4.  He does this in almost every chapter.  For this specific exercise, he made reference to \"void\" and is using functions to catch errors, which hasn't been covered at all.  Why does he do this?  Is the intention to force the learner to reference outside sources to complete the exercises?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with learning this way, but if I'm sitting in the book trying not to use outside sources as an attempt to remember, make use of the content, and find creative solutions to the problem, then I get stuck, reference the answer key to see what I am missing, and find a bunch of return types and functions not covered in any way, it seems kind of stupid that these are needed to complete the exercises, which seem to be designed to cover the content from the chapter.\n\n\n", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Personally, I think it is a pretty crappy book.
