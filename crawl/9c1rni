I do know if statements and the most basic stuff, but I don't know where would I start, and I don't know about unity though. So please help me where to start to create this, thanks :)", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "First off youd either be better off posting this in either /r/Unity3D or /r/Unity2D and seeing as you have a basic grasp of programming already it sounds like you just need to learn the software environment and from there figure out the logic for your game.\n\nFor a good grasp on the unity environment I recommend starting with a pong clone which a good tutorial should be on the first page of Google \"unity pong tutorial\".\n\nFrom what I grasp from what you're saying it sounds like mostly be based off stuff like place meeting and collisions which is fairly simple and the pong tutorial should teach you.", "id": "e57ekv1", "replies": [{"body": "Thanks man, I'll learn the simple pong and begin from there :)", "id": "e57eqnf", "replies": [{"body": "If you need any further help message me and I'll see what I can or can not do.", "id": "e57f24d", "replies": [{"body": "Sure thing :)", "id": "e57f2wm", "replies": []}]}]}]}], "title": "Help me to start in making a C# game"}
