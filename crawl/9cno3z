The thing need to really update and I went back and forward with it as a blog to a portfolio. I'm honestly wondering if it's even worth while to keep paying to keep the site up since it doesn't bring in money when it's a blog, and I don't think it ever helped me out when I had it as a portfolio.", "score": 21, "comments": [{"body": "Yeah, of course it is worth it. Companies need to be able to see your work. If you don't think it is worthwhile to pay, Just use a service like Netlify or even Github pages. Recruiters/hiring managers are used to this.

Hell yes!\n\nA website and portfolio with projects proves that you have hands-on experience. Hands-on experience is the best thing you can have for a potential employer. It shows that you don't just have the knowledge, you have actual experience with gettings things done. On top of that, it gives them a good insight in your coding style. That will give them the best indicator of your coding skills.\n\nKeep in mind that for an employer, even a degree or work experience related to the field does not guarantee that the person sitting in front of them actually knows how to code. There are too many people that have a degree, but can't code.
