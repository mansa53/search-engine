Can someone describe me, what is going on in code?  \n\n\nCode:   \n\n\nfunction outer(a) {  \n\n\nfunction inner(b) {  \nreturn a + b;  \n}  \nreturn inner;  \n}  \n\n\nvar f = outer(3);  \nf(5);  \n\n\n//output: 8  \n\n\n**What I have tried:**  \n\n\nI was trying to guess it, but actually I can't get to know, why is ouput 8. In the first is set parameter 3 for outer (a = 3). So   \nfunction inner(b) {  \nreturn 3 + b;  \n},   \nbut after that we set parameter **a** for function **outer** to 5, so function inner(b) {  \nreturn 5 + b;  \n} ?   \nNo, I really can't understand what is going on in code.   \n\n\nBtw I'm really young student.

So the result looks like this:\n\n    function f(b) {\n        return 3 + b;\n    }\n\nNow you call this function with `f(5)`, and you get 8.", "id": "e53d8da", "replies": [{"body": "That\u2019s a good simple way to put it, also read about closures.

In there we create a function inner which returns  a + b. Remember a is 3 so its like saying return 3 + b. Then we return the function inner as a return value. so now f = inner function. so when you say f(5) you are basically calling the inner function with the value of 'b' as 5 which returns 3 + 5.\n", "id": "e53dhfy", "replies": []}], "title": "Javascript algoritms problem"}
