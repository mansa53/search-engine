This is my current code: [https://repl.it/repls/MixedSpecializedJavabytecode](https://repl.it/repls/MixedSpecializedJavabytecode)\n\nEDIT: I'm doing this challenge in Javascript.\n\nSo my main idea is to assign weights to each quest, and then choose the quests with the highest weights until I exceed to timeForQuest time limit.  I already realize one problem with my code - I don't account for the possibility of quests that have the same weights, which in my code, would make for duplicate keys.  I haven't found a way to handle this - are there any revisions that could be made to keep my code from becoming too inefficient?  Or is there a better way to approach the problem?  Any help appreciated, thanks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Here is the challenge. \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/WRtdAlL](https://imgur.com/a/WRtdAlL)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "It requires a login, so there's not much help we can give you.", "id": "e5adr00", "replies": [{"body": "Ok, I added a link directing you to pics of the challenge.", "id": "e5amgb2", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "It seems you may have included a screenshot of code in your \npost \"[Help with this codesignal challenge...](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9cfwqa/help_with_this_codesignal_challenge/)\".\n\nIf so, note that posting screenshots of code is against \n/r/learnprogramming's rules: please **edit** your post to use one of the \n[approved ways of formatting code](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_formatting_code). \n(Do NOT repost your question!
