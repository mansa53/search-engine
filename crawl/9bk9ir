I have even tried printing the PDF file with different scaling it does not work.\n\nI even tried creating ASCII file but somehow the line breaks in this printer is larger than the output on the screen.\n\nI have been trying to look for any resources on how shall I proceed and I have only found the character sets that this printer supports:\n\n    Italic table, PC437, PC850, PC860,PC861, PC863, PC865, Abicomp, BRASCII, Roman 8, ISO Latin 1, PC 858, ISO 8859-15\n\nAlthough, the printer(Epson FX-2175) is not a requirement; this is the only hardware that I have currently that I have access which supports multi-part forms printing via impact printing on a carbon paper. I know I am asking a lot I just need some advice on how shall I proceed with this project.\n\nShould I look for a newer dot-matrix printer, if yes; what specifications should I look for so it can support PDF Files?Is there any website that has some resources I can research on regarding dot-matrix printers?Should I just give up and burn this old piece of crap?  \n\n\nEDIT: I think I found [the solution](https://mike42.me/blog/what-is-escpos-and-how-do-i-use-it).

PDF documents are designed to be rendered for the target device, so it's not just a file full of text characters you can just print.

For example you can tell it to use a different font size, or different spacing between lines, and things like that;\n\nThis seems to be the code: [http://www.lprng.com/RESOURCES/EPSON/epson.htm](http://www.lprng.com/RESOURCES/EPSON/epson.htm)\n\nTry outputting a file that has these escape codes in it and see if they work.\n\n\u200b", "id": "e53mw8x", "replies": [{"body": "Yeah!
