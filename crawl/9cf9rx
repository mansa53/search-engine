We want it to be a good tool for people to develop their skills. We also hope it will encourage people to develop more of an interest in the field.\n\nWe would love your feedback on the hacking elements of the game.\n\nFor more info, see our website: https://defungames.com/\n\nTo stay up to date on the latest updates and developments follow our Twitter: https://twitter.com/DefunGames (@DefunGames)\n\nThanks for reading, and we hope you'll check out our exciting project!\n\nEdit 1: Wow, we never expected this kind of support!

A lot of people use open source scripts to get a nice empire going but the downside to that is you can go look at their code (very few modify it as the open source options are pretty nice).

For example if you know they spawn an expensive defender when an enemy creep enters the room just walk a super cheap one in and back out to strain their economy. You can hit all their remote rooms at once and strain their economy defending those and replacing the workers you killed all while you have a creep draining their towers and eventually their economy won\u2019t be able to keep up and they\u2019ll miss a spawn on an important worker creep and you just wait it out and take the room.
