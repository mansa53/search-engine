I just got a call about an interview on Friday for a company that uses C++. I am a new grad and only have experience in Java, Python and C. Can you recommend a C++ crash course for someone who already knows the basics and only needs to learn syntax and language specific stuff?", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "It's only going to be possible to get the *very* basics and you'll probably mess those up.\n\nI think your best bet is to be honest. \"I don't know C++ at the moment, but I am familiar with Java, Python, and C. I'm confident at my ability to learn C++ quickly, but I'd prefer to conduct the interview in one of those languages\"\n\nI got a job programming Java despite having no professional (and very little personal) experience with Java with essentially this line. They agreed that I probably *could* learn Java very quickly.", "id": "e4xfbe6", "replies": [{"body": "Thank you. I did ask them about the coding part of interview. They said the questions are geared for C++ but i could answer them in Java. i assumed C++ wasnt so different after knowing C and Java that i wont be able to pick it up quick.", "id": "e4xhh9z", "replies": [{"body": "C++ is a very, very big language. Knowing both C and Java going in gives you some advantage, however, because you'll be familiar with C syntax, objects, pointers (probably, although C++ doesn't use them as much), dynamic and static allocation, generics (although templates are much more powerful than Java generics), and a few other things. That's a good start, but C++ is not a language you can pick up in a few days.", "id": "e4yi3ia", "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "C++ is C. With more stuff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObjects and pointers, bro. Stuff ain't a crash course if you don't know it already.", "id": "e4xusda", "replies": []}], "title": "C++ help"}
