I am learning with online courses and know some basic stuffs like lambda and function.\n* Java because it is official language for Android, which is what I really want.\n\nI did lots of research and read lots of other forums, most of them said Python is beginner friendly language than Java or other languages like C, Swift and C++. \n\nMy interest is in making mobile(Android & IOS) and desktop apps, so should I continue Python or start learning Java or C or C++ or HTML, CSS as I am beginner. I am fed up googling my questions, now I just want to start learning and taking action.", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Just start learning! It really doesn't matter much about which you choose. There really isn't a wrong answer. So if you want to do Android, then pick Java.\n\nUnfortunately most people starting out put way too much emphasis on this question when it really isn't a big deal in the grand scheme of things.

I'd go with html css js and whatever your brother does for backend. Helping him will give you a lot of experience and you will learn a lot faster.

Rather than having to jump into strict syntax rules, Python reads like English and is simple to understand for someone who's new to programming.
