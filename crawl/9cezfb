What things have you learned?  Do you have any code that you've written so far?  Any rough work?  I would guess you learned how to push, pop, and access elements in a vector, right?\n\nAs this is homework, I will not give you a solution, but I am happy to guide you to an answer.", "id": "e5a6m3z", "replies": []}, {"body": "Here's a hint, try a for loop or a while loop, or Google recursion ;)", "id": "e5a6o5x", "replies": []}, {"body": "I didn't think C even had Vectors natively?\n\nIf you mean an array and know of loops, you know how to solve it!\n\nI'm not sure how helpful this is, but I'd try just thinking about it not in terms of code, but if you had a physical (unordered, presumably?) set of boxes with numbers in.  \nWhat if you wanted to see if a given number was in any of the boxes?
