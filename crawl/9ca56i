Maybe you're someone who would like to convert to C# or learn object oriented programming. Maybe you simply want to help or share your experience? Well then, how about learning with a help of a teacher, within a community full of people just like you?\n\nWe're a growing community on Discord- C# Inn, focused on sharing our experience and help people to start off as programmers or become better at what they do and grow.\n\nTwice a week I offer free lessons on Discord for two groups of people:\nFor those who know nothing (programming principles) and for those who know some (oop and c#). Lessons are in a format of live coding on cooperative wall on Rextester.com. Lessons material is being added every week, written by me and posted on Discord. I try to record everything too, but so far I was a bit lazy about it. Everything is free of charge. \n\nThe best way of learning, in the end, if by doing something yourself. So we are forming groups of 3-5 people and by the end of September will try to start making group projects.\n\nIf any of that interest you, go ahead and join our community :)\nOur Discord can be found at:\nhttps://discord.gg/vWE4Pc9\n\n-Have a good day :)\n", "score": 5, "comments": [{"body": "Sounds amazing   and thank you for making it for free.
