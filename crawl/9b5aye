For arguments sake lets say I want to play GTA v on PS4, how would I go about getting all the inputs, would that be some sort of realtime photo recognition process? Also, how would I output the controls, would I have to manipulate a physical controller to be then used by the program or could send signals straight to the console some how?\n\nAny help or direction would be great!", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": "I found \"Gray Hat Python\" book by no starch press.
