Why have a validator just dedicated to /. ?\n\n\"SiteName validator\nThis validator fails on these characters: /.?\"\n\n    validationType=\"siteName\"\n    validationParameter=\"\"\n\nAny clarifications I could get on this would be VASTLY appreciated!", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "> but why would \"ApplicationPoolName\" fail on these specific characters?\n\nMSFT has decided they're invalid in whatever field it gets stored in.\n\nIIS and Windows have both evolved over time since the validator was introduced, and so has the meaning of the validator.  I don't know which one is newer, so I can't say whether they added more characters or reduced the number of restricted ones.  ", "id": "e51sttz", "replies": [{"body": "Ah!
