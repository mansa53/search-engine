From what I have understood from my research, I have to learn JavaScript, C++ or C#. But I do not know from which language should I begin with. Please share your opinion. Also, should I learn from edX or apps available on Play store?\n\n\nP.S. - I installed Ubuntu 18.04 last week.", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": "C# is the language of the [Unity 3D engine](https://unity3d.com/), so that might not be a bad idea.\n\nIf you feel up for the task of something harder, C++ combined with [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com) will also let you do this.\n\nRegardless of language or engine, realize that 3D games is among the hardest things you can do in programming.

You may have heard of 'Java', a very different language which is used more commonly for 3D rendering through libraries such as LWJGL.
