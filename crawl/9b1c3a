I'm need of some direction and guidance as to how do I go on to practice for placements. I'm a senior undergraduate in B.E. Computer Science program, have fairly average coding skills and been working on Web development projects since my freshman year. \n\nCompanies started visiting our campus earlier this month, but I seem to perform poorly in my coding tests. I've been practicing a lot, especially focusing on Data Structures and Algorithms but have been able to fetch little to no results. Been focusing on my projects as well, but haven't been able to secure a job as of now. Some tips and personal experiences will help alot\n\nP.S. : English isn't my first language hence I apologise for any grammatical errors.\n\nThank you", "score": 0, "comments": [], "title": "Need some guidance regarding placements"}
