The optimizations that Julia have applied only make sense if you have been programming for a significant period of time.\n\nIf you look at the history of languages, there are always languages that will come up. Sometimes, these languages are made by somebody who were tired of the state of art.. they were sometimes pretty good ideas, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the languages survived themselves. Most of the time, the existing standard got modified and incorporated the innovations that the new language provided to the ecosystem.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean that new languages don't come up.. but from a cursory overview Julia doesn't seem to be a very significant improvement over Python, that the improvements can't themselve be included in the Python core library.", "id": "e5ad6sd", "replies": []}], "title": "What is everyone's thoughts on Julia programming and is it a good language for beginners?"}
