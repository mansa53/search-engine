However the issue that has held me back from doing so, is that we cannot install any software on our PCs, so this has restricted my use of coding because I can't install an editor\n\nHowever, I've recently noticed that Windows 10 comes with the text editor \"code writer\". Now I know I can write code in the but I can't actually find an option to execute the script. I was just wondering, is this possible in this app?\n\n", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "As admin, you should learn/know *PowerShell*, the current Windows Scripting and administration programming language.\n\nSeriously, if your coding fails for an editor, you don't know much about coding.
