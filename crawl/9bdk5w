I firstly started on PHP and MYSQL, building some basic websites and applications. After that, for a last 8 months, I got into Laravel framework and I really like it. I started to develop some more serious and more difficult web applications to really get into it. Now, as I'm learning, I realized there's much more behind back-end than just Laravel, so my question is, what programming languages/programs should I start to learn next? I thought about learning Javascritp, node, angular and that stuff, but not really sure where to start. I'd appreciate any help. Thank you", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": "JavaScript and Node are good technologies to learn. JavaScript will give you an understanding of how the frontend works and so might improve your understanding of the context in which a backend runs. Node is useful because it has a very different model than PHP: data can persist across requests whereas PHP starts fresh each request, for example.", "id": "e52bl8t", "replies": []}, {"body": "Hi, this could help!\n\nhttps://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap", "id": "e537k6i", "replies": []}], "title": "What do you need to learn to be a back-end web developer?"}
