I get how to print arrays, find the sum and averages so far. I use a for loop to traverse through an array & use an int placeholder = 0 and compute. However, I'm stuck on this challenge and can't wrap my head around it. How do I write a method that would work for any given Array? Also, we have to return the values back in an Array & display it as such? Any help is really appreciated!

You create a new array with the length of the original. \n\nI\u2019m going to skip over any syntax errors for right now. I know learning syntax is extremely important, but for now let\u2019s just focus on the logic. \n\nLet\u2019s take a given array of [1,2,3,4]\nYou would expect the result was [5,5,5,5], \nor [1+4, 2+3, 3+2, 4+1]\n\nI see you have a nested For Loop, which you were using to instantiate a new array, but I think you were trying to take the locations of the argument array and add them together. \nSo let\u2019s just step back and think about what we are trying to accomplish. \n\nWe have our array we need to traverse the array, adding the elements together from the \u201cends\u201d of the array and moving one element left and right. \n\nSo let\u2019s say we have two variables, a and b. Let\u2019s start a at the beginning of the array. So a= 1. And let\u2019s assign b to the end of the array so b=4. \n\nWe want to add these two elements together and store that value in the new array. So we can store the 5 in the new array. \n\nNow we need to move a one element to the right in the array and we need to move b one element to the left. So a=2 and b=3.  We sum them and store that value in our new array. \n\nWe again move a and b and we get a=3, b=2. Sum, store and move a and b so that a=4 and b=1. \n\nSo you see we need to move a and b at the same time, a nested For Loop allows you to move one of the elements at a time, but not both simultaneously. \n\nAnother helpful tip is if you look at the location of a it corresponds to the same array index as your new array. So when a is at location 0 (arr[0] ) that is also the same location as you want to save your new array value. \n\nHopefully this helps.  I don\u2019t want to just solve your problem for you. Coming to the answer yourself I found was the best way to truly grasp the concept. \n\nLastly, you only need to create one new array in the beginning of your function. You want to avoid creating a new array in a For Loop. But you can access your newly created array by using your Loop variables. Like this. NewArr[a] = oldArr[a]+oldArr[b]", "id": "e52is4y", "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Start by solving this on paper.
