I'm just wondering if I've been using a good one or if there is a better one out there. I've heard that something like Project Euler just gets very math heavy. I know that the best practice is projects, I just want to do stuff on the side, edabit helped pick me up a few tips on certain ways to do things on my own projects since you can also see what everyone else had done to solve the problem.\n\nI've also seen codewars on here, how do they compare?
