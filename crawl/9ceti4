Your Git path is 'mounted' as the root directory (that way, /bin/ls is actually something like C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\ls.exe), and drive C: is /c, drive D: is /d, and so on. This is done so that tools designed for or which assume a UNIX system can run in Windows. The compatibility is done thorugh MinGW's MSYS system. You can think of it as similar to Cygwin, but very lightweight. You can use notation like 'C:/blah/blah/blah' instead of '/c/blah/blah/blah'. You can also use backslashes, but shells require that they be quoted or escaped: c:\\\\\\\\blah\\\\\\\\blah\\\\\\\\blah or 'c:\\blah\\blah\\blah'.\n\n\n", "id": "e5aaiqa", "replies": []}, {"body": "That's the intended behaviour IIRC.\n\nAlso if you like using Bash on windows then look into WSL if you're on Win10.", "id": "e5a5sfh", "replies": [{"body": "Highly recommend WSL!", "id": "e5a660i", "replies": []}, {"body": "I'm on win7", "id": "e5a6a7k", "replies": [{"body": "Not available on there, unfortunately.\n\nAlso a bit off topic but I totally feel you.
