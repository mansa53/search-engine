{"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9b1tec/recently_learned_the_basics_of_java_where_to_next/", "text": "So recently I was at a camp where they taught the fundamentals of Java, which gave me a pretty nice boost in terms of learning as what I learned were the foundations. Now that it's finished, I find myself in a lost state; it's quite interesting. I don't really know where to go next to achieve my goal, which would be to get proficient in Java. There are obviously many more things which I must learn, and I'm not sure what path to go along to learn what's necessary. It seems like all the topics are \"disconnected\" in a sense. \n\nWhat sort of path would you want to go along to learn? I've heard much about learning by doing, which of course is the best way, but then you must have a topic to practice. Would you just go along naturally with something you want to make? If it helps at all since it's easier to learn with an end goal of some sort, it is to develop my own Android apps.\n\nThanks!", "score": 3, "comments": [{"body": "Here some sites you can check out: \n\n###Exercices (including easy to hard):\n- https://www.w3resource.com/java-exercises/basic/index.php\n- https://www.codinGame.com (this one is more fun)\n\n##Tutorials (written):\n- http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java/index.html\n- http://zetcode.com/tutorials/javagamestutorial/ (2D easy games)\n- https://medium.com/heuristics/interface-vs-abstract-class-vs-concrete-class-196f20c3af9a\n- https://www.sololearn.com (more practical dont really recommend it)\n- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jdbc/index.htm (java database connections etcra) \n- https://www.javacodegeeks.com/ (has some nice guides)\n- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/index.htm (java basic to advanced)\n- http://www.javacjava.com (fundumentals of java to make sure you didnt miss anything)\n\n\n\nThat should keep you busy for a while. --verd", "id": "e4zs0z4", "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for taking the time to write all of that up for an internet stranger!
