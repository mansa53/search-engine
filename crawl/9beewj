Is this a good and updated website to study and learn from?\n\nAny suggestions?", "score": 11, "comments": [{"body": "I learned C++ bit by bit over the years, and I can't give you a review of any particular learning resource.\n\nHowever, I **can** tell you the two sites I use most for reference while writing C++ day to day: [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/) and [godbolt compiler explorer](https://godbolt.org)", "id": "e52loq9", "replies": []}, {"body": "CC /u/JingleDingleBilly.  I just took a look.  That site has *some* useful info, but by and large, it's suboptimal:\n\n---\n\n[This graphic](https://www.learncpp.com/images/CppTutorial/Section0/Development.png), while technically true, is misleading because it mixes abstraction levels.\n\n---\n\nSection 0.5 recommends an IDE without explaining why.  In fact, an IDE can be a great tool, but I recommend anyone starting out to start with a texteditor, and either compiling your programs by hand or writing a batchscript (windows) or shellscript or makefile (linux/macos) to do it for you.\n\n> Note: If \u201cHave g++ follow the C++14 ISO C++ language standard [-std=c++14]\u201d exists for your version of Code::Blocks, use that instead.\n\nWhich is complete bull.  If it wants to teach c++11, then great!  That's modern, but if your code is wrong and you're compiling as c++14, then it's possible you'll get a different or wrong error message (say, if you typo and type the wrong typename, which actually exists in c++14 but not in 11, so you'll be prompted to include the header that contains that type instead of saying that type doesn't exist).  There will be plenty of time to learn about fancy new features in c++14 and 17 once you've gotten a handle on the language as a whole.\n\n---\n\nSection 0.6 says:\n\n> type/copy the following into your compiler\n\nYou should ***NEVER*** copy-paste code from the internet.  Always type it out by hand.\n\n> If you are using a much older C++ compiler, the compiler may give an error about not understanding how to include iostream. If this is the case, ~~try the following program instead~~ here is how you install a more modern compiler\n\nFixed that for them\n\n> A build configuration (also called a build target) is ~~a collection of project settings that determines how your IDE will build your project~~ not something you should have to worry about for a while, focus on learning how to program instead\n\nFixed that too.\n\n---\n\n---\n\nUnfortunately, I don't know of a better site, but I would recommend against using this one.  cppreference is very good (I also use it as a reference for c), but it's not really geared towards teaching you the language.  Maybe try _The c++ Programming Language_ by stroustrup?  I've never read it, but it's by the guy who wrote the language, so I doubt it's that bad.", "id": "e52ma1n", "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the info dude. I'm not expecting a full review of all the sections, but that could be a nice project for me or anyone else - I might end up doing it later.\nThe author has been updating it since 2007 so there could be some outdated info here and there.\n\nMoving forward, I think I'll read through Bjarne's books and Primer 5th edition.

From the site you linked to it looks like it's more of a reference style, possibly useful if you need to refresh a specific topic. However if that's your aim (reference and look up), then cppreference.com would probably be much better for that. The information is more detailed and the example code snippets are more informative.\n\nFor studying and learning a book is better because it explains things as they go and also good ones suggest exercises that you should be able to complete after each chapter.
