I think I ought to use a Net Standard 2.0 lib so that I could reuse the project elsewere but I'm struggling to get any of this working, I've literally been through the whole list on nuget. Please can someone point me at a lib that I could be using and give me a bit of an explanation of why my Xamarin stack isn't playing nicely with a Net Standard lib? \n\nThanks, ", "score": 1, "comments": [], "title": "looking for an mqtt lib for Xamarin/Android"}
