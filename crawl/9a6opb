There's so much out there, I'd better get some pro advice. If too ambitious at least tell me where to start. \n\nWhat you need to know:\n\n\\- I'm brand new to coding (hard core...know nothing)\n\n\\- Fortunately I'm driven by a very motivating project:\n\n\\> create a visual of an interactive guitar neck and be able to set notes, chords, etc...responding to commands (e.g. a A chords> bam! the chord comes out). Eventually I'd prefer add colors to it (I mean to the notes). No need for sound for now.\n\nThanks guys\n\nalfredolcrapo", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "Any modern language is fine.
