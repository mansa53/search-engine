I am trying to figure out this whole SSH thing.\n\nI followed the little tutorial GitHub has on how to generate an ssh-key and how to hook it up to GitHub. I followed it and it works fine but I name it \"test key\" in GitHub and I put my password as something random. It works, I can connect to my remote repos, but I have no clue how this whole thing works.\n\n1) Do I only need one ssh key to use for all services that connect with ssh? For example: would I connect to GitHub and BitBucket with the same ssh key? Basically, is ssh key something unique to me like an ip address or something?\n\n2) If I wanna connect to my remote from another computer do I have to create another ssh key? Can I migrate the ssh key I have somehow? (No clue how these keys work).\n\n3) If someone gains access to my ssh key can they access my repos if I don't have a passphrase on my key?\n\nI would appreciate an explanation or a link to an article that explains them in simple terms (I searched for some but I couldn't understand much. and the results were not as relevant to GitHub and such.)", "score": 3, "comments": [{"body": ">and the results were not as relevant to GitHub and such\n\nThat's because this isn't a Github-specific thing, it's an SSH-specific thing. If you want more information about this, you can search for \"asymmetric encryption\". \n\n>Do I only need one ssh key to use for all services that connect with ssh\n\nUp to you, but ideally you'd create your own key, and use it for all the SSH servers you're connecting to.\n\n>If I wanna connect to my remote from another computer do I have to create another ssh key\n\nYes. \n\n>Can I migrate the ssh key I have somehow?\n\nYou actually want separate keys for different machines.\n\n>If someone gains access to my ssh key can they access my repos if I don't have a passphrase on my key\n\nOf course.

When you generate an SSH key, you generate a public key, and a private key.
