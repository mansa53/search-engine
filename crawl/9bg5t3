If you can take a class in data structures or algorithms you will be really getting a step ahead. \n\nI think Python, C++, Java, and Rust are all pretty good languages to pick up for beginner programmers, though I want to reiterate that the specific choice is not terribly important when you're just starting out.", "id": "e52sxf0", "replies": [{"body": "C++ maybe not so much, because a large portion of the tutorials online use old/dated concepts like raw pointers. The language is also a real behemoth, meaning that it's not something a beginner can just pick up and start using.\n\nI like Rust, and it's far better for beginners. Python would probably be ideal, though.", "id": "e52uyrj", "replies": [{"body": "Raw pointers are pretty fundamentals. Not that you shouldn't learn how to use smart pointers, but to say that raw pointers are out dated is a misunderstanding.", "id": "e548dbc", "replies": [{"body": "I'm pretty bad at writing out my own thoughts, so apologies for that. I didn't really mean that raw pointers are useless, per se, but using smart pointers is usually far safer because the abstractions help people write better, more secure code. Not having to focus on memory management all the time lets you focus more on the problem at hand, not to mention reducing the chances of memory leaks.", "id": "e555i92", "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "I\u2019ve just started at college and I\u2019ve used python, C++, and Java so far.
