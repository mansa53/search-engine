Partly as a back up, partly because I just like that sort of thing!\n\nI'm not a beginner and not advanced either.  So I'm looking for a book on projects, applications.\n\nBut I don't want to fork out too much on several books.\n\n\u200b\n\nThanks,", "score": 180, "comments": [{"body": "[Algorithms and Data Structures in Python](https://www.wiley.com/en-ie/Data+Structures+and+Algorithms+in+Python-p-9781118290279) is your best bet. It's nearly 800 pages long, filled with a tonne of projects / real life applications and covers all the basics (syntax, oop) in the first couple of chapters. If you can get through the majority of that book, you'll have no problem passing a coding interview. It's a 'university standard' textbook and a must have if you're going to dedicate yourself to programming. After this the next step is AI / Machine learning.\n\nOnly downside is, its something like $230. You can find pdf's online but a hardcopy is pretty expensive. So I'd say take a look at the PDF's online (free if you look in the right places) and see what you think, try a chapter or two and see how you like it.
