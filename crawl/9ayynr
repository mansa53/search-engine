I believe this helps a lot in that when re-designing, you will be forced to use your own fonts, icons, images, and color palettes to get a similar look, in doing so, you will definitely catch an eye for what works and what doesn't.\n\n\u200b\n\nYou can find the website here: [https://muchkler.github.io/UIHubs/](https://muchkler.github.io/UIHubs/)\n\nand to help you out with your challenges, there is also [https://muchkler.github.io/designHub/](https://muchkler.github.io/designHub/) with a lot of design resources.", "score": 66, "comments": [{"body": ">We will be sending you one user interface to work on per week.\n\n>We will be sending you one user interface to work on per week.\n\n>We will be sending you one user interface to work on per week.\n\nJust in case it wasn't clear, we will be sending you one user interface to work on per week.", "id": "e4zadam", "replies": [{"body": "Rofl, thanks for pointing it out.

CSS Zen Garden, if I understand correctly, gives you a pre-made HTML file and lets you go ham with CSS.
