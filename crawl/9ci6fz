My logic is there, I just wouldn't know how to get to my goal. \nWhen taking programming courses,  I had friends help through my assignments and now I'm super worried I'm not good enough because my professor said the assignment should take an hour, if longer we need to drop the course.\nAny advice to fix foundational issues along side tackling tough programming problems?

Pull out the rubber duck if you need it.  Do not get hung up on how to program it, as that's an area people get screwed over by.  Focus on pseudo-coding it or logic-ing it out mentally.  Once you do understand the problem and how to solve it, then go code it.\n\nIf you're spending a long time on it, then take a walk, take a shower, exercise, or in general just go do something else.

You never learnt *to program*. You missed out on the analytic, logic part of programming and that is severely hindering your progress. You need to go back, do some simpler assignments and work your way up. Probably, you will not be able to follow the course with your current level and it will take too much time to get up to the required level.", "id": "e5b5w1c", "replies": []}, {"body": "> I usually get hung up in the coding portion.\n\nThis is why you use pseudocode. For example, \"mark numbers to false in the array if it is a multiple of any number, like 2 to 4 to 8.\"\n\n    Let A be an array of bools, A[0]=false, A[1]=false, ..., A[n-1]=false.\n    For i in 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1:\n        If i is a multiple of 2 or 4 or 8:\n            A[i] = true\n\nBy writing it out as pseudocode you can step through the logic and see if what you're planning makes sense. Once you've refined this, then you can focus on translating it into an actual programming language. For example, how does one create an array of bools in your language? How does one check if a number is a multiple of some other number, and so on.\n\n        ", "id": "e5b669b", "replies": []}]}]}], "title": "What to do when you're unable to do a programming assignment?"}
