What would be the best option for me, dual-boot or Virtual Machine? If knowing my hardware helps, this is my list (https://pcpartpicker.com/list/ppjH4q). I will use W10 for Video Editing/Photoshop and Linux for programming.", "score": 3, "comments": [{"body": "probably a virtual machine. You'll get used to the partitioning tools you'll be using in real life without putting your existing windows storage+partitions at-risk.", "id": "e4vrgf6", "replies": [{"body": "Even though the Virtual Machine is a little slower?", "id": "e4vrn1a", "replies": [{"body": "emphasis on *\"A LITTLE\"*, modern virtualization is great. You really won't feel the slowdown at all with CPU, RAM, or Storage.\n\nThe slowness you'll feel (if any) will be just due to the fact that your graphics are going to be entirely software-based.", "id": "e4vrp9k", "replies": [{"body": "So, if I increase the GPU usage to like 2 or 3gigs, would that make it better?", "id": "e4vrwb6", "replies": [{"body": "VRAM will likely not be your issue. You can look into PCIE passthrough (pass a whole GPU through to your VM) but it's probably not worth your time.\n\nPerformance is fine and even if video/graphic performance isn't as smooth as it could be it will have zero impact on you learning centos.", "id": "e4vs389", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "If you are going to deploy a CentOS server, might as well start a CentOS instance in the cloud. Digital Ocean in a good option. AWS, App Engine, Microsoft, Heroku, etc.\n\nThe programming can be done via an SSH Tunnel in pretty much any shell client.
