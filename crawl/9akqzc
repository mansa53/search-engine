Which is great, but I already know HTML and CSS that I get bored, but skipping to the JS often leads to issues of skipped JS information.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone have somewhere to fill the JS gap without having to watch through hours of HTML/CSS again?", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": "[this](https://www.edx.org/course/programming-web-javascript-pennx-sd4x) ", "id": "e4wi0qk", "replies": []}], "title": "Learnt HTML, CSS (SCSS) Now onto JS, any recommended tutorials?"}
