I finished FCC's Javascript course few days ago, and now I don't know what should be my next move, or what should I learn next?\n\nAlso, what do you think about FCC's HTML5/CSS3 course? I was thinking of doing its project part as I had already learned the HTML5 and CSS3 from the Udemy course. A lot of people told me why are you wasting your time on CSS as it's too old now and there are so many frameworks nowadays that can easily help you create an elegant website. So, I am too confused now if I should do those projects first or should start with something new.", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "I wouldn't consider CSS to be old or outdated. If you want to be a web developer you need to have at least a solid grasp on CSS and how to use it. It is significantly more valuable to have solid CSS fundamentals then know some CSS framework like BootStrap. I suggest building your own projects. FCC projects are fine in this regard. You will learn a lot more by completing these on your own then by completing the code challenges their curriculum gives you. After you knock out some projects move on to the React Portion. Then I suggest that you start to build some projects using React, Vue, or Angular. Those frameworks are currently the most employable in the United States.

I will complete FCC's CSS projects first :D", "id": "e5czuw8", "replies": [{"body": "All of that being said though, I wouldn't spend too much time specifically on CSS. Spend a few days on it and learn some of the deeper concepts like key frames and animations. Maybe look into Sass. But remember it is best to focus on the big picture and use it in conjunction with HTML and JS and actually build projects that are challenging and interesting to employers.

But, still I don't think I can add these projects in my portfolio.\n\nWhat kind of projects would you suggest though that I can add into my protfolio and are worth showing to employers? I am thinking of watching Traversey media youtube channel for the projects part.", "id": "e5d0z3d", "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Completed it today too.
