I have heard that I will need it for data structures and algorithms.

Feel absolutely so behind in school even with over 60 credits. I wait last minute on literally every thing and I want to start learning discrete math now if possible. \n\nFree or paid online sources please? Thank you.

I'm pretty sure you can watch the entire discrete math class from MIT on there. Don't freak out, discrete math is not hard, and it only really becomes important when you get to analyzing algorithms, and I honestly didn't think it was that helpful even for that.
