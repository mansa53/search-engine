But the professor is messing up the class (IMO), he is giving us content that other professors don't touch at all. \nWhat I mean is that the contents of the course are basically Conditionals, Structs, Pointers, Functions, Data Structure in general, Arrays, Files, etc. But this professor is giving us things such as Templates and some exercices from advanced algorithms. My point is that all this things are pretty much overwhelming me. \n\n\nAny advice on how to study \"complex\" things such as templates, abstract data types and this things? I need tips more than resources.\nI don't want to lose my annual course. Thanks in advance.", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "Does the course have prerequisites? Have you studied programming before? Personally I think it would be easier to first take a general programming course so that you are comfortable with the programming language mechanics, abstraction in general and so on.

Assignments?  \n\n", "id": "e54zc8z", "replies": [{"body": "It's a first year course. \nMy problem is the speed of the course pretty much. For example:\nLast week we studied for the first time FILES in C++. This included all the functiones like FILE, fread, fwrite, and so on. Now what we have to do in order to study is making functions like **template <typename T> T read(FILE f);**. \nI understand that this is a function that works just like fread but for general data, to be specific, it works for Abstract Data Type. \nSo far I could only understand FILES and how general functions like fread, fwrite, work. But now the professor ask us to develop this functions like template typename mention above. Do I have the problem with abstraction things? is the professor taking the things too quick?\n\nThanks once again and sorry for my bad english.", "id": "e55wrry", "replies": [{"body": "Have you studied programming before?
