It's very hard to read.\n\nNow onto your (actual) problem: you say you're getting a loop that's prematurely ending.  This is likely homework, so I'll throw you a hint.  That's probably not the issue... you should probably look i...  \n\nIf you run from 1 to 10, notice how it always seems to fail at 5!  Right after 4... what happens at 4?  Particularly, what happens to i?\n\nAnd regarding your second question, it just means you have a calculation that you aren't using the value of, so the compiler's just warning you, so if you really aren't using it, you can just remove it as it's useless otherwise. \n\nFinal tip: Don't mix and match \\n and std::endl.  Just pick one and stick with it.  They do the same thing here,\n", "id": "e5ctroz", "replies": [{"body": "Fixed the problem. It's working now.Thanks a lot.
