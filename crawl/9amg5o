{"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9amg5o/semantic_html_tags_and_why_they_seeming_dont_show/", "text": "So I've been trying to pick up some web development, just ran through the first certification on FCC and did some additional digging on resources like Mozilla's web development thing. In all the sources I've looked at, I've seen things labeling the importance of semantic tags and stuff like that. When I look at the sources of just about every website, I don't see a main tag. Most websites I see are just mainly div tags as containers with a header and sometimes nav and footer.  \n\nI have seen some sites with section tags, but I haven't found a single website with a main tag or an article tag. Why is that? If I am trying to make a good website should I follow that? Or should I just go ahead and use those semantic tags too.  \n  \nOne thing I have read, however, is that tags like section and main aren't necessarily good for styling and that styling should be done with div tags. Is this redundancy of possibly having to wrap a page wrapper div tag with a main tag?  \n  \nAny help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you very much!", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": "It's mostly due to legacy and automation reasons.  \n      \n    \nDivs have existed for a long time.
