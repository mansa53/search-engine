If so what languages are your forte?", "id": "e53pzvz", "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for the anwser. Yes, I can code in PHP, HTML, SQL, ecc.. but i prefer to let these things do to a plugin, where if this is possible", "id": "e53r5f8", "replies": [{"body": "Cool. Well WP, would definitely do what you want then. The plugin User Role Management is pretty lightweight and provides the permission controls I described. Not that you couldn't code it, but it's convenient and stable, in my experience. Woo Commerce is a popular plugin for e-commerce sites too, as it does just about everything, but like you I'd prefer to code my own. Still I leverage some good plugins which make for building the backend much easier/convenient; Advance Custom Fields for modeling and Gravity Forms with the Authorize.net add-on makes a fine shopping cart for just about any use.", "id": "e53s03o", "replies": [{"body": "Thank you again. I understand. Meanwhile there is some plugin that can make the users uploads their files and decide their name, categories, price to sell, ecc..  ?", "id": "e53tz00", "replies": [{"body": "Woo Commerce would be the way to go if you don't want to roll your own. Using the ACF plugin's Repeater capability (requires the 'Pro' version ... worth it IMO though) could give you the same functionality without too much backend mucking around. Inventory control would require you to write your own callback after the CC transaction. I imagine (for myself at least) that would be the most challenging part.", "id": "e53uyyo", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}], "title": "Is this possible?"}
