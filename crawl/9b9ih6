I read this [article](https://medium.com/@gajus/do-not-protect-your-website-from-scraping-part-1-technology-barriers-b0ced398d16d) that talks about how businesses can try to attempt to block spiders.

You've automated the process of stealing their data to use for your own purposes; *of course* they're going to fight against you. They don't know that you're trying to use it for personal purposes. And even if you are, you're consuming their resources, without the possibility of viewing their advertisements or whatever other mechanism they use to offset the cost of hosting.\n\n>Makes me think that there are some engineers who hold a negative perspective on crawlers\n\nI'm one of those engineers. I wouldn't necessarily judge you based on the fact that you wrote a scraper, but I'd probably ask you about the ethical questions around it and what you think about them, and judge you based on your answers. I don't know how broadly my opinions are shared. But I personally wouldn't scrape a site unless I had explicit permission to do so, and if I were asked to do so for work, I'd object. But I'm in a position at work where I can do that, not everyone can.", "id": "e51aoyt", "replies": [{"body": "I see, thanks for sharing your opinion, that was exactly what I was wondering. Yes, I think there are definitely reasons why some websites are fighting crawlers. Obviously, they need to make sure no one will break their website and use up all of their resources. However, they also must be allowing crawlers at some level, for google and such if they want their webpages to show up on searches. They often have robots.txt that have limits for bots to follow. If you worked for Google or another search engine, would you not work on their googlebot that collects web pages? Do you think that is unethical for search engines to endlessly crawl?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: follow up question - Do you think adblock is unethical? ", "id": "e51bxgp", "replies": [{"body": "I don't, because Google isn't scraping your data to repurpose/resell it. They're indexing your site and actually helping generate *real* traffic from real people that has a chance to get ad impressions. That indexing is far more valuable than the bandwidth they consume generating it. And Google respects limitations. They honor `robots.txt` and don't attempt to circumvent blocks.\n\nI'm not philosophically opposed to crawlers in general, I'm opposed to scraping data from a site that clearly tries to block you from doing so. When you have to actively circumvent limits just to capture the data you want, IMO that's unethical. I'd say to ask yourself how you'd feel when you've published a site with data that you're generating or buying, only to have a 3rd party collect it all (at the cost of your expensive bandwidth) to re-use however they feel, for free. You'd probably not like that at all.", "id": "e51d2rq", "replies": []}, {"body": "> edit: follow up question - Do you think adblock is unethical?\n\nThat's a bit tougher. As the client, I should have explicit rights to what code executes on my computer, but at the same time, the free content model only works when there's an alternate source of income (like advertisements). So to me it's a gray area.\n\nI balance the ethical issues against the \"cost\" of leaving ads enabled. For me, the balance tips towards using an ad blocker, because ad networks are one of the most likely vectors for certain types of malware and other security risks. Add that to how annoying they are, and that to me tips the balance in favor of blocking them.\n\nAlso note that all of these responses are just my opinion. Others may feel free to disagree.", "id": "e51gp1k", "replies": [{"body": "Hey, I appreciate all your opinion, as that was what I was seeking. I will consider your thoughts next time I am building an app, and perhaps it is not a great app design if it necessitates using someone else's data.

If those sites have public APIs, then there's no problem at all. That means they built in data sharing into their platform. \n\nThe other problems with scraping that we haven't discussed is that it's brittle. If the site changes their markup at all, it can completely break your scraping processes. So that makes it at a minimum a dangerous app design, if not necessarily bad.", "id": "e51hlxi", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Everything u/insertAlias has said is perfectly on point.\n\nWithout giving away specifics, have you looked at public and/or open source data for this project?  \n\nMany NGOs have tons of pertinent info available through a better API than a scraper.\n\nIn my professional capacity, if a candidate admitted to violating intellectual property rights by bypassing protocols, it wouldn't disqualify them but it would make me dig a little deeper as to why they chose that method instead of another.", "id": "e51j6r6", "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, I appreciate all the feedback! Yes, there was an open source database but it had not been updated for ten years or so, so it was missing a lot of information. I incorporated and also found another random person on github with a similar project, and received their data that they used after exchanging a couple emails with them. Combining these two, I had about 8000 data points. There were several websites that had pieces of data I wanted to gather, and I did access one of them through a public API, and followed their rate limits. One other website responded to an API key request after about 3 weeks, by which point I didn't have a need for their data anymore. The others did not provide public APIs, nor a robots.txt instructions that I could find, just IP bans when I first tried to scrape, leading to me trying to bypass their bans. Honestly it was the first time I was scraping and I was not aware of all the protocols involved.
