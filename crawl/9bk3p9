I am a beginner in C#, and I'm trying to execute a block of code under a certain condition.\n\nThe condition is that a string should not be null. If it's null, do nothing, but if it isn't, then execute the code.\n\nThe thing is that I'm looking for a way to do it so it doesn't execute the code more than once, while the string is not null, because it keeps checking.\n\nHow could I do that?
