{"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9amn9j/team_treehouse_tech_degree_what_do_you_guys_think/", "text": "Sup guys,\n\nSo I recently came across Team Treehouse's Tech Degree program -  I knew of the $25 or $50/month options they had, but this was the first time I saw the tech degree program/curriculum. I am not so much interested in the \"tech degree\" itself, as I know it is essentially an obsolete piece of paper stating you finished the course so that is not the reason I am interested in it. The curriculum, projects and portfolio help, however, seem very good and streamlined for someone who is learning on there own and hoping to get a junior developer job in the near future, like me.\n\nI've been learning front end development for the past 6 months or so. I powered through HTML and CSS  (taking various courses online, udemy, freecodecamp, etc.) and then dove into JS. However, about a month ago, I went back into learning CSS because previously,  I was learning it all based on bootstraps and I really wanted to get a grasp for CSS without bootstrap. I wanted to learn flexbox and grid. So, I am now starting (somewhat) from the beginning and  re-learning most of the stuff (or essentially touching up on it/reviewing it). Not to mention I've been traveling for the past 2 months so I haven't done much coding within that time - so I am refreshing my memory and getting back into the whole thing.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe problem is, I am constantly looking for new material/courses/videos/tutorials to learn from, bouncing all over the place, from topic to topic, language to language, and I am finding it difficult to focus or complete and learn one thing before moving onto the other, because I am using a lot of different resources and constantly bouncing around from topic to topic.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis is why the Treehouse tech degree really interested me - it has everything streamlined into one for the most part. No doubt that I know I will be using other resources along with it, but having a majority of it laid out, and separated by topic seems like a really beneficial thing, as well as a good timeline to follow and track my progress.\n\n\u200b\n\nI also am doing freecodecamp, which is good, however I feel as if that it is only supplemental  material. I was learning from it, but certainly not as much as I was hoping. I am going to complete the freecodecamp program however,  while I am doing the treehouse one.\n\n\u200b\n\nI know that this treehouse tech degree may not be for everyone, but it seems like  with someone who is learning this completely on there own, it would be a great thing to follow.\n\n\u200b\n\nI have a degree in sociology and graduated last year, but found out I really don't want to do anything within the social services sector - which is why I am now learning this on my own, with a goal of  becoming a front end developer (possibly full stack), possibly/eventually getting into UX design to incorporate my sociology degree. However, my goal right now is to get a junior web developer job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think of the Team Treehouse Tech Degree program, regarding what I mentioned above? Has anyone here done it? I am talking about the $199/month plan.  Any information regarding it would be useful\n\n\u200b\n\nTL;DR Really just looking for advice and personal experiences with the Treehouse tech degree  - specifically the web developer one, for someone who is learning web development on there own and also has some experience, but needs something more streamlined with project and portfolio help. Anything regarding the Treehouse tech degree would be useful\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": "I used the cheapest version of team treehouse for quite a while and found it to be a good starter resource. Things are really well explained and they have a pretty helpful forum to ask for help in.\n\nI would not recomend the tech degree option. All of the lessons in the tech degree are available on the cheapest option and there are often bonus challenges given at the end of videos anyway so you get practice still. \n\nI often see people like things like these because they give you a structure but there are tracks that provide similar structure for the cheapest options anyway (theres one for front end development and many back end languages)\n\nIf you really want the techdegree tho you can always start with the cheapest option and then upgrade when you think you can complete the challenges and tests quickly. This way you get the best of both worlds", "id": "e4x618j", "replies": []}], "title": "Team Treehouse - Tech Degree - what do you guys think?"}
