I am planning on transferring to Ohio State University for the CS and Engineering  major. I have plenty of time on my hands before I transfer and I wanted to ask on this community what you guys recommend to study. Maybe languages or something related to CS courses that may help me to be prepared for the major.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been looking for FREE and PAID courses but I can't seem to find any good sources.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice is much appreciated.
