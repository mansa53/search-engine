From How To Become A Hacker by Eric Steven Raymond:\n\n>It's best, actually, to learn all five of Python, C/C++, Java, Perl, and LISP.  Besides being the most important hacking languages, they represent very different approaches to programming, and each will educate you in valuable ways.\n\n[http://www.catb.org/\\~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html)\n\nBTW the document above isn't about cracking.

So in that sense you\u2019re \u201cmessing with computer systems\u201d. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t try to learn both at the same time. Pick the one that you like more and focus on that. They\u2019re similar though so after you learn one learning the other will be easier. C is what windows was made with. Although I don\u2019t known if it\u2019s exclusively C. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of hard to directly answer your question about hacking though. Can you be more specific about the types of things you\u2019d call hacking? \n\nI don\u2019t know much about hacking but what I\u2019ve seen mostly involves a network. As in someone intercepts packets coming from one computer and injects malicious code (c or c++, or whatever) and sends the packet on to the original recipient. If the original recipient were then to run that malicious code, it could do all kinds of things. Encrypt a hard drive and hold it ransom for example.
