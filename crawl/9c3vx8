I am trying to figure out how to write a code that asks someone a question and gives them a yes/no option. depending on what they answer, the console will write something  back to them.\n\nFor example\n\nC-Console\n\nU-User\n\n&#x200B;\n\nC-                                                                           Do you play games? \\[Y/N\\]\n\nU- Y/YES                                                                                                                         N/NO\n\nC- Loser, get a real life.                                                                                                Good, they're all low lives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\^ Just some random shitty example (its late at night okay dont judge)\n\nSo to summarise i need help to make a code that will take you to a different answer depending on if you pick yes or no.  \nThanks in advance!\n\n&#x200B;", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "What have you tried so far?
