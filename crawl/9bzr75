C++ is a bit different from Java/C#, as it's a lower-level language, however it's not that difficult to learn if you have any experience in programming in other object-oriented languages. It's used mostly by larger companies because it runs a lot quicker than C#, as C++ compiles straight to machine code, rather than binaries that are read by an interpreter. Just remember to use pointers and take care of your memory, and C++ won't be that frustrating (after a while)! :D", "id": "e5711u2", "replies": []}, {"body": "If you're already familiar with java youll find C# very similar. Im not sure about integrating C# or C++ into eclipse, but you should definitely give Visual Studio a try before you look into ways to integrate those languages into eclipse, you might like it.", "id": "e572uai", "replies": []}], "title": "Learning C++ and C# after Java"}
