I'm currently working on a React Application, and have an index.js file. This contains all of my react code, and is rendered client side currently. I want to be able to start splitting that JS file up into different modules, containing my different React Components. When I attempt to use require, or export, or import, I get an error stating require is undefined. Digging in a little, it appears require is not supported in browser and I have to use something like webpack. Was having a bit of an issue getting webpack set up unfortunately. So, my question is -- Is there a simpler way to modularize my code, or do I need to start diving into webpack?", "score": 3, "comments": [{"body": "`require` is from Node.js, not JavaScript.", "id": "e5bvvcg", "replies": []}, {"body": "i don't know if this will fix your issue, but i was able to use import/export by adding `type=\"module\"` to the script tag in an html file.", "id": "e5bwh3u", "replies": []}, {"body": "you pretty much do have to use something like webpack. Just download a react/webpack boilerplate, don't try and set it up from scratch. It's not ridiculously difficult to set it up from scratch, but it can be a little tricky. Much better to just get the ball moving. Webpack doesn't really require a lot of programming itself, it's really just a program you install and give a configuration file and then you hardly touch it again.
