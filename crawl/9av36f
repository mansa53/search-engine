I'm new to Python, basically new to programming overall. The reason I'm choosing to learn Data Analysis through Python is because once I get that down I want to learn the Python language more in general.\n\nSo I've learned pretty much only the basics of Pandas and Matplotlib so far in Pandas, I can load up a CSV and 'manipulate' data. Manipulate data as in I can apply logic to a set of column(s) to achieve a result. So far in Matplotlib, I know how to create the basic line plot and bar/pie graph.\n\nNow the problem I'm having is how do I combine both Matplotlib to visualize the query I get from the logic I gathered using Pandas? The way I learned matplotlib is to use python lists as my sources for the X and Y axis, but I'm not sure how to instead use the output I get from Pandas?", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "That works but you can also plot using your dataframe directly!\nhttps://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html\n\nEdit: To add a little bit more, if you want to filter first you can use the .loc method. Typing this from memory but you can pass some logic to this method and get a filtered dataframe as the output. Then you can plot this filtered dataframe. \n\n`df2 = df.loc[df[\u2018A\u2019] > 100]`\n\nhttps://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.loc.html\n\nAfter you do this you can also plot the new dataframe directly with the .plot method.

It seems like it'll be more convenient to use pandas for everything ", "id": "e4ygv5j", "replies": [{"body": "Pandas plots are Matplotlib in the background! Pandas just provides some convenient ways to plot from dataframes directly. It says that on the first link above: \u201cMake plots of DataFrame using matplotlib / pylab.\u201d\n\nI typically use Matplotlib or something like Seaborn instead of the pandas plot method. I should probably use the pandas one instead of Matplotlib most of the time.  \n\nYou can typically pass python lists / pandas series data to any of these.
