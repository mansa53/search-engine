This really surprised me and wanted to ask why? (perhaps the reason my surprise and this post already indicates how poor my programming education has been)\n\nHeres' the [article](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/dec/04/ict-teach-kids-regular-expressions)", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": "That\u2019s not what the article is saying. Doctorow is pointing out that programming concepts such as regex are far more useful to non-technical people than technical people realise. The vast majority of kids who learn programming will never program again but there are concepts - such as regex - which can be applied easily by anyone who uses a computer.\n\nHe\u2019s not saying \u201cif you are learning to program, do regex first\u201d but \u201cif you are going to teach ICT, teach concepts that apply widely\u201d. You can be a great programmer and never touch a regex but learn them and you will use them every day, regardless of whether you are programming or not.
