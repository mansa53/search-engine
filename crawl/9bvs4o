Once you click submit, you are taken to a page based on conditionals, for example\n\n&#x200B;\n\nif funding last 18 months:\n\nreturn crunchbase page\n\nelif google news article last 30 days:\n\nreturn google news\n\nelse:\n\nreturn linkedin\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have beginner html, c and python knowledge, but pretty inexperienced programmer. How would you advise implementing this, and do you see any problems with the process outlined below?\n\n1. Take \"search\" input and go to crunchbase, google news, and linkedin pages\n2. Use beautiful soup to extract html\n3. Use python to parse text, finding key fields like dates \n4. Return most relevant link, based on specified conditionals\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": "Are you taking user input and searching in another page?\n\nYou could see if Linkedin/google news/crunchbase has an API which would return something other than HTML, such as JSON.\n\nYou may also want to check to make sure you're not breaking any rules of crunchbase/linkedin/google by using a different interface to bypass theirs", "id": "e563oit", "replies": []}, {"body": ">Use beautiful soup to extract html\n\nAnd *constantly* update your application each time Google News, LinkedIn, or Crunchbase makes any changes at all to their markup. \n\n\"Scraping\" is a very fragile and unreliable technique. You *can* get the data you need that way, but like I said, any time any of those companies change their website markup even a little bit it could break your scraper.\n\nLuckily for you, all three of those platforms have APIs:\n\n* https://developer.linkedin.com/#\n* https://newsapi.org/s/google-news-api\n* https://data.crunchbase.com/docs/using-the-api", "id": "e566f8o", "replies": []}], "title": "Help implementing smart search idea - python, html"}
