However, there\u2019s no \u201cproject\u201d folder like in c::b where I can start new header and source files, so they\u2019re not properly linking when I try to include new custom headers in my code. Anyone more familiar with Geany that is happy to help with this?", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "This is all done simply through an invocation of g++ behind the scenes.\n\nYou can either do it manually with g++ in terminal, or look up how to edit the configuration of that text editor.\n\nI don't use Geany, but there are resources online just looking it up.", "id": "e4x864f", "replies": []}], "title": "Hey, does anyone know how to link header files and source .cxx files to main.cxx in Geany?"}
