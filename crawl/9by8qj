I wanted to implement what I had learned, and so I started to build fun mini-projects and I ended up learning so much more. Two years ago, I created a blog with a couple programming project tutorials. Now, I've built a whole platform. I'd love to hear your thoughts and suggestions to improve the learning experiences of anyone learning to code. Also, if you'd like to contribute, be sure to let me know.\n\nHere's the site: [https://enlight.nyc](https://enlight.nyc)\n\nThanks!", "score": 46, "comments": [{"body": "One. Fantastic that you're giving back to the community with this web site.\n\nTwo. Great examples.\n\nThree. Especially good that you have some examples that really start from the ground up.\n\nFour. Can't say that I care much about the ones that are basically gluing library calls together.\n\nBut overall: good stuff.", "id": "e56qv18", "replies": []}, {"body": "Loved it, and it's free unlike the competition.. The projects also seem to be challenging and interesting at the same time. You should add career paths to a specific type of CS career track. I would also try to monetize it in some way, keep the content type you have now free, but add some cool premium features, like access to a source code, built in compiler, relevant articles etc. I am in my second half of the junior year, but when I graduate I will definitely will be donating and supporting as much as I can.
