I just to know, what do you guys think is a better way to do so? \n\nP.S.\nI enjoy both making apps and \ngames.", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "I've no idea the financials or market details, but the impression I get is that there are millions of apps/games out there and the market is absolutely saturated. Being a good app probably isn't enough by itself.\n\nAnd also ad revenue seems to be at a bit of a low, though I'm not sure if that's true of mobile apps, I'm thinking of sites like YouTube when I say that.\n\nSo, it doesn't seem like the best way to go to me, but I may well be completely off base.", "id": "e4z1tv2", "replies": []}, {"body": "It's easy to release an app onto the Play Store; easier than the Apple App Store. The challenge is building a user base. Usually to do that you'll need to advertise, which involves *spending* money. So now you're spending it in hopes of making it. You can do it, but you need a great app, and to pull in multiple hundreds of dollars a month, you're going to need a quite large userbase (or a large userbase for several apps), and that's a tough thing to do for a new developer.\n\nI probably wouldn't plan on this as a realistic income source.", "id": "e4z2cgy", "replies": [{"body": "Do you have some other ideas?i will need that money for college.", "id": "e4z48zc", "replies": [{"body": "Lol", "id": "e4z7aqb", "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I suggest you give up on making game and try to make an utility app that meet some people\u2019s daily needs .
