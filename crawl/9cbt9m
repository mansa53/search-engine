We're a small group with sql knowledge in building datawarehouses, ETL and reporting. Knowledge of coding is def there, but we're not skilled in things like c# or java.\n\nWe have a shortage of web developers and no money in the budget to hire one so they figured they could purchase this software and make us into sql developers and web developers with the same pay of course.  We have one java developer who started to play around with this new software and even he says there is a strong learning curve. Does anyone have any experience with learning software such as K2 where they claim anyone can build a webapp from scratch? After I started playing around with it, I realized learning java or c# might actually be easier than trying to use this software. You get to a point where you are on step 50 of a tutorial and have no clue what you did or why you did something.", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": ">...

Honestly if you just want to build web apps there are much simpler ways of going about it. In fact if it's just dynamic content like a blog, portfolio site, magazine, etc, you don't even need to code, just use a CMS like WordPress/ghost/etc. Even otherwise, [this](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/) is an example of a framework designed for \"rapid app deployment\"; a one page quick start tutorial and you're running a web server.", "id": "e59o727", "replies": []}, {"body": "Why is your business pivoting to K2 instead of getting in on the billion dollar big data train? Strong warehousing and data transformation skills for big data are in pretty high demand right now. Stupid pivot imo. \n\nEvery single one of those products that promises to rid your organization of costly programmers is trash.
