Web Development without Java in backend\n2. Web Development with Java in backend\n3. trains you in technologies based on how well you perform in coding rounds using C/C++/Java\n\nDisclaimer: This list is limited to what i have searched for till now.\n\nI have a little bit more interest in learning web development with the stack offered by the colt steele program and i also want my basics in DS and AL right so i bought his course on the same using javascript.\n\nIf i had the time then i would learn java properly doing both the courses and then learn web technologies through other courses. \n\nAll i want to do is get a job in this field fast and then figure out which path to proceed.\n\nThats where i need your help. Can you help me decide from the following list of courses which ones to focus immediately?\n\nI can average 6-8 hours in a day.\n\n**The Courses i have access to :**\n\n**For Java:**\n\n1. This course is an introduction to basic java programming:\n\n[https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming)\n\n2. This course covers various data structures, algorithms and preparatory resources for interviews:\n\n[https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**For Web Development:**\n\n1. Web development by Colt Steele\n\n[https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/content](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/content)\n\n2. Java Script algorithms and data structures by Colt Steele\n\n[https://www.udemy.com/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/learn/v4/content](https://www.udemy.com/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/learn/v4/content)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance.", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "I would stick to what interests you more. \nThat\u2019ll help motivate you more for completion.
