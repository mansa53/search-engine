So I've been programming on and off since I was in about 8th grade, I am currently a freshman in college. I was wondering where you guys would recommend to start in regards to making a bot(that in majority teaches it self) that grabs data from the stock market, and then decides what's the best trade to make in accordance with that. Somewhat like the automated investing bots sites like [https://www.kapitall.com/](https://www.kapitall.com/) offer. Thank you all, I hope you guys have an absolutely amazing day!", "score": 1, "comments": [], "title": "Deep Machine Learning and Finance"}
