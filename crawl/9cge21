I was working in Laravel and VueJs but I leave it as standby project, now I'm working in a college project developed in Ruby on Rails, this thing is magic and more easy to work, so I'm having trouble making this decision, frontend is not my thing but I want to learn it. What you guys recommend to do that? Maybe learn some bigass frontend framework like Angular or ReactJS.
