I do not work in the technology field, but my company does work with Visual Basic for macro's and application use (alot of excel macro's).   Would it be better to learn VBA to start out, as I could work on some stuff at my current job for project experience? Or would I have better use of my time to learn another programming language like JavaScript or Python.  I do not have a goal in mind at this point, just want to start to get into programming.
