As I am 13 years old, my school has a program that helps us decide our careers, for me, I had no idea. It seemed like all my friends had clues of what they wanted to be except me. Not until I heard about web developing, I heard about it on a certain article, specifically \"front-end and back-end developers\" shortly after I learnt about full-stack developing and spent 2 weeks thinking about doing that for my career. (I was always interested in how people made websites, lol when I was little I did inspect element on webpages and showed them to people \"bragging\" about how I could hack, stupid me) Anyways after 2 weeks passed and no other careers interested me, (except ethical hacking, always wanted to troll those damn scammers) I made the final decision of choosing to be a full-stack developer, since I have already started to learn html and css (just the basics, nothing fancy) I wanted to get a clue on what I should do from there, I practice everyday and try and perfect the basics of html and css before I move on to more advanced levels of it, (I know html and css aren't the only necessary languages to become a full-stack developer but I have to start somewhere,) these are the videos I have watched to learn the basics of html and css: [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0afZj1G0BIE), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ13lX20FqU&t=3s), and [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWPMSSsVdPk)\n\ntldr; I'm a complete noob in web developing and want to become a full-stack developer. I only know the basics of html and css and want to get help from there, what should I do?", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Being \u201cFull stack\u201d also means you need to know the back-end part of website/software development.\nHTML/CSS is the front-end portion.\nYou\u2019ll need to focus on more back-end technologies, like databases (MySQL/MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server), Web server configurations (IIS, Apache, Nginx), and software backend configuration if you\u2019re to use prebuilt tools like CMS\u2019s (Wordpress, Drupal, Sitecore), and anything else that exists to support the HTML/CSS/JS/etc. that you create for the front end.
