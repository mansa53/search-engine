Because of extenuating circumstances I will be graduating in 2021 instead of 2020. By the time I graduate, I will already be 24 and this is not ideal for me.\n\n\u200b\n\nI guess my question for you guys is: if I invest 10 hrs per week and continue learning python for the next year (I am in the basics right now but it is very intuitive since I am experienced with java) could I find a career in programming that pays very well?\n\n\u200b\n\nIf possible I would like to even drop out of school as crazy as that sounds after I am very experienced with programming and simply pursue a career in programming and put my excellent scientific and numerical skills to use.", "score": 3, "comments": [{"body": "> if I invest 10 hrs per week and continue learning python for the next year (I am in the basics right now but it is very intuitive since I am experienced with java) could I find a career in programming that pays very well?\n\nSure but you could also win the lottery.\n\nI'm a self-taught developer who is currently a working professional.\n\nIf you have the option of going to school, do it. It's much easier this way. You MIGHT get lucky with a lot of hard work and you MIGHT get a good job. There's also a huge chance that you won't get anywhere. No matter how good you are, unless you're doing something amazing, you need luck on your side.\n\nI'm not going to lie to you. School is easier. Graduating at 24 is not a big deal. You'll be okay.

So far this is all theoretical... besides the contract.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn terms of my progress with Java we did delve into topics like encapsulation, arrays, interfaces using abstract class, etc. What interested me very much in my programming for engineering course was one particular problem where we took a sequence of genetic code and manipulated it using an array. Individual methods that have such complex functionality are very interesting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also have created a GitHub and plan to use it as a way to document my own personal progress as I create more complex and sophisticated apps.", "id": "e4zdre7", "replies": []}]}], "title": "Self taught programmer still in college"}
