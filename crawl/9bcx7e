Google offers an introductory course for free and I have a Lynda account that gives me access to an AWS Machine Learning course for free as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy question isn't about how to begin my first program, it's about how I set up these APIs to begin with. I have no clue what IDE to use (IF I use an IDE in the first place) or where to run the code. I guess what I'm asking for is a tutorial for how to set up TensorFlow (or AWS, but preferably TensorFlow) on my laptop/desktop (both run Windows 10 64 bit) so I can actually start learning these things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso if anyone wants to make fun of me for being a freshman in college working on Machine Learning in the first 3 weeks of school, this would be the place to do it.", "score": 1, "comments": [], "title": "I Want to Get Into ML Using TensorFlow/AWS; Where Do I Start?"}
