So, a PLA (Peer Learning Assistant) in one of my classes told me that the best languages to know as an IT major are C#, Python, HTML, and Python. He said maybe C++, but only if I want to learn it.\n\nI was wondering what you guys think about that.", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Each language was built with a purpose.\n\nIf you want to do web development, then HTML (not a programming language, but a markup language) and CSS (also not a programming language, but a styling language) and Javascript will be the technologies used in the front-end (the visual and interactive part of your website). To do the back-end (logical part of your application) you can use C#, Java, Python, Ruby, PHP, Go, and even Javascript again.\n\nFor mobile development, you will use Java or Kotlin. For desktop, you will probably use C++. For embedded systems, C and C++.
