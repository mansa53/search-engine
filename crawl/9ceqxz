Very, VERY wrong.  Think about it.  What does the \"=\" operator do in this case?  What are you currently doing?  Are you allowed to assign a function call to a value?  Your prof was right, in that this is the one line that is broken.\n\nRemember, programming isn't one-to-one with how, say, math works, especially when it comes to the assignment operator (this thing: \"=\").  Let's say I wanted to do this:\n\n    int a;\n    int b = 10;\n    a = 2 * b;\n\nThe above is valid.\n\n    a / 2 = b;\n\nThis is NOT valid.", "id": "e5a57vb", "replies": []}, {"body": "C doesn\u2019t have a value before you square root it.
