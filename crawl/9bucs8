So basically I used some code Github user NobodyMe wrote and added in .ini reading and wallpaper setting so that it will set your wallpaper to the top image of, say, the past week from /r/battlestations.\n\nI have compiled this into a standalone .exe as well that can be found in the build folder on my github. I'm still relatively new to programming and would like some people to let me know what they think and what could be improved, if that's not too much to ask.\n\nthanks!", "score": 3, "comments": [{"body": ">I have compiled this into a standalone .exe as well that can be found in the build folder on my github\n\nDon't do this! It's terrible practice to check in any build artifacts. Use a `.gitignore` file to exclude your `build/` folder. \n\nUse the instructions here to actually upload packaged releases:\n\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/\n\nSide note: don't expect anyone here to download compiled binaries. That's a great way to get infected by malware. For feedback here, all we need is source code.\n\n>So basically I used some code Github user NobodyMe wrote\n\nI see that you've provided the username in the code, but that's not really good enough. You can ditch the whole \"author: NobodyMe\" stuff, and include proper attribution in your readme file. Link directly to their github project and say that yours is forked from theirs.\n\nYou should highlight that this is Windows-only, since `user32.SystemParametersInfoW` isn't going to work on a mac or linux. That's a Win32 dll.\n\nRename `setWallpaper2` to `setWallpaper`.\n\nI'll leave the rest of the feedback to Python people.", "id": "e55ukvm", "replies": [{"body": "Thank you :) good point about the compiled binaries not being downloaded for safety purposes.
