I also understand how pointers work in theory.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess its the execution that completely loses me, since my C experience so far includes a couple hours on hackerrank. My instructor gave us a .tar with some scripts, with [this](https://pastebin.com/R5WWXxv9) being our starter code. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you could ELI5 it would be greatly appreciated", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": "My interpretation of that mess of an assignment is :\n\nYour function is passed a function `store` which you call to modify `x`\n\nAfter the call, x will either contain  `01 00 00 00` (4-byte 1 in little-endian) or `00 00 00 01` (4-byte 1 in big-endian).\n\nUsing the `byte_ptr` pointer,  determine which of the two possibilities occurred.\n\n\nThe comment line\n\n    // One of the four bytes will have the value 0.\n\nis incorrect.
