Recently, I've come across many threads of the form: \"Help, I am new to programming should I learn Y JS framework or Z Web Development framework\"; while I think these threads are fine and generate a modicum of useful discussion, I think the majority of the people posting these questions are asking the wrong question. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nProgramming is a rapidly evolving field. There are always going to be new tools to learn and new technologies to learn. Attempting to learn all these technologies or as many as possible is a recipe for disaster! There simply isn't enough time in a human's life time to touch all of these technologies. What I would suggest to most of these people is a principled approach. Yes, you need to learn some framework or programming language to express and reason about principals, but answers to these types of questions recommending a framework or a language are necessarily opinions. I feel that there is little gain for the learner from these answers. If someone is working on a project, their requirements will impose some trade offs that will make certain tools more favorable, but learning is different. You can pickup any tool and create a project that fits within that tool's capabilities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wanted to post this thread to bring this issue into consideration. Personally, I don't object to the questions themselves being asked but, in my opinion, they should be answered with a wiki post explaining why the question isn't always conducive to a useful answer and urging the user to rephrase the question in terms of needs. For example: \"Should I learn Python?\" could become \"I want to learn how to write TCP/IP servers. What are languages with good support for that?\" Both questions will result in opinions, but the second form acknowledges this.", "score": 1, "comments": [], "title": "[META] The right tool for the job."}
