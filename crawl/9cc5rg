I ended up writing a few helper functions and have a really nice library that does MANY things jQuery doesn't do and like i said it's <200 lines. My fav feature is `FillForm(form, data)`. Then by coincidence it was perfect for `FormSubmit('#generic form', json_data)`. I had a list of comments on my site and didn't want form html for every comment. So I had a generic comment form and used javascript to build json_data. So implementing FormSubmit took only a few minutes.
