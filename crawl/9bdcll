If so, can anyone try and point me in the right direction?\n\nI've looked at different VoIP services like Twilio and Nexmo, but they don't offer the ability to access the live audio stream from a call that's happening in real time. I want to get that audio stream in real time to send to my server and process it myself for other uses.\n\nWould appreciate input from anyone on this!", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Ask the NSA, they\u2019re pretty good at stuff like that", "id": "e52b3va", "replies": []}], "title": "Real-Time Phone Call Audio to Server?"}
