I work as a mechanical engineer and am looking to develop a gui program to generate automated reports. These reports would be prefferably PDF and would have some tables and text in them, that part I got down.  What I am struggling with in a way to generate diagrams. These diagrams are similar to a P&ID (Google it if you don't know) showing valves and piping connections. What programming language, library, third party addin would you suggest? Totally at a loss here. I can provide more details if needed to find a solution.", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Microsoft Visio (minimum Professional version) is a great tool for P&ID.
