I figure this would be free to setup, would not require anything special like a server or anything that I remember and would be more fun to build a game rather then some tool or application.\n\nIf it goes well, transition it to some sort of 2d game. \n\nDoes this sound like a plan or should I be looking at other languages to start out? What are your thoughts on this?", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "I think it's a great idea.\n\nDon't underestimate kids, Google has programming classes for 6 year olds and in some places they teach HTML5 in grade 6. (Maybe even earlier elementary)\n\nI'd suggest teaching the basics before jumping into a game or application (the same way you were probably taught)", "id": "e55vpcm", "replies": [{"body": "My college courses started me on php I believe. But the whole semester was unfun things like random number generators or blackjack. \n\nI thought it would be more engaging to teach the basics in the structure of ending in a text game that each of them can spend time tweaking to their own stories and stuff. So same lessons, just more \"fun\" along the way I hope?", "id": "e55w4jk", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "My favorite way to teach kids algorithmic thinking is to use the tools on https://code.org.
