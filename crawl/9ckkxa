If not - retry request with dont_filter=True\n\n    if not hxs.select('//get/site/logo'): yield Request(url=response.url, dont_filter=True)\n\nWhen I put this statement at the top of my parse method and search the response object for website name, I get the following error\n        raise ValueError('All proxies are unusable, cannot proceed')\n\nAny help is appreciated", "score": 2, "comments": [], "title": "Scrapy ip rotation problem."}
