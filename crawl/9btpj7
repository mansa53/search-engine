I'm wanting to be employable as web developer within the next one to two years, but I'm not necessarily in a rush.  Circumstances prevent me from being able to return to college to pursue a four-year degree in CS, but I've been thinking that it might be beneficial to work through the courses suggested by r/http://www.teachyourselfcs.com for a while and then do some self-study or go to a bootcamp to learn the more practical skills.  I've been going back and forth on whether to do that, but my gut instinct says that at least going through some of the courses will likely make it easier to pick up JavaScript and web development as a whole, if only through an increased understanding of how things work in theory.  Any thoughts or recommendations?", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Maybe Harvard CS50x? https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x", "id": "e55ny5m", "replies": []}], "title": "Should I look into doing courses on CS fundamentals before learning web technologies?"}
