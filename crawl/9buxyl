It\u2019s neither a virus or malicious like people are claiming you would have to use to accomplish what you want. You can basically write custom macros / scripts to run programs, or do something when a certain condition is met. Plenty of companies use it to automate processes and lots of people use it for writing macros for gaming etc. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve done anything with it but I know you can like open word and have it type something in just from the press of a button. I don\u2019t know if it will listen for multiple keypresses in success but it looks like [this documentation](https://autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Input.htm) may be a good place to start looking. This was only from a 2 second google search, it may not be what you\u2019re looking for but I figure it can get you started and maybe you can find some ideas.\n\n\nEdit: fixed the first link.
