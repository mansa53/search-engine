My three choices are Computer Engineering, Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering , but my main picks are Computer Engineering & Computer Science. \n\nComputer Engineering I\\\\it's something that I'm interested in quite a lot mainly due to the coding side and having that diversity in knowing the coding and hardware side of things. I imagine having the knowledge in both the hardware and software side of things will attribute to having more options when trying to obtain a job. But I'm not sure if I'd like the hardware side of things.\n\n\u200b\n\nI have some questions that I hope this subreddit can answer to ensure that I'm 100% confident in diving into either a CE or CS major\n\n\u200b\n\n1. How big is the demand for Computer Engineering majors vs Computer Science majors in the workforce?\n2. Which major has more job opportunities?\n3. Which major will have a harder time finding a job out of college?\n4. Is Computer Engineering really 50% Electrical Engineering and 50% Computer Science?\n5. Which major is harder and how hard is that major's curriculum?\n6. Which one is more math heavy?\n7. If I choose to be a CE, what type of field will I most likely be working in?

I can answer number 4 for you: Yes, computer engineering is pretty much 50/50 EE and compSci. I like my major actually. It is a really diffcult major by the way...lol . Not for the faint of heart of course.\n\n\nPM me if you have more questions.", "id": "e5ckt6r", "replies": []}, {"body": "(I\u2019m a Senior Electrical/Computer Engineer at University of Maryland, and have been a teaching assistant for 3 semesters now. That being said, take my advice with a grain of salt.)\n\n(TL:DR) Both majors have similar job opportunities, all things considered. CE is about half EE and half CS. Difficulty depends on you, but both take time and effort. CE needs more math. CE jobs can really be either. (Depends on what you chase.)\n\n1-3. I think all these questions fall under the same category of job potential. Both fields have an a vast pool of job opportunities from individual contracting (small coding jobs) to full blown government positions. There is a high demand for both majors, so neither has a huge edge over the other. And neither major should have trouble getting a job out of college. If I had to guess who has more job opportunities, not considering quality or longevity of the job, I would have to say CS. Many non-computer companies need computer-literate people for short jobs, and IT positions.\n\n4. Yep, about straight down the middle. Maryland\u2019s department of Computer Science is its own thing. Whereas Electrical and Computer Engineering make up one college. So, I would say that Comp Eng leans slightly toward hardware here, but that is only my experience.\n\n5. Difficultly is kinda subjective based on where your skills lie. (I.e. Math isn\u2019t too bad for me but destroys other Computer Engineers.) I can say that both majors require time and effort. I feel busy most nights of the week consistently throughout the semester. My friends in CS feel the same way. Neither are cake walks, and that\u2019s really all I can say without spouting my bias opinion.\n\n6. Computer Engineering. You will take more circuitry classes that require understanding of some low-level differential equations. (Here you need to take Calc 1, Calc 2, and Diff Eq for the Computer Engineering major.)\n\n7. As a CE, you could really end up in either, but you are more likely to end up in hardware in some capacity. CS majors have specific interview questions that they focus on learning (usually algorithm centric.) CEs don\u2019t have as much exposure to those topics, so that is a slight disadvantage in strict high level coding jobs. But other than that, you really can work wherever opportunities show them selves. As a CE myself, I have spent the last 3 semesters teaching the strict coding classes rather than the hardware classes.\n\nHope this helps!

CE is, well, engineering.  So it will likely have a more engineering-style curriculum.  At least in my school, that means a hellish schedule and a pretty rigid course outline.  CS, on the other hand, is (at least for me) part of the math faculty, so if you're bad at math, then you might get booted first year.  \n\n6.  Depends.  I would say CS, but as I just mentioned, my school's CS is literally part of the mathematics faculty.\n\n7.  Probably whatever you prefer, honestly.
