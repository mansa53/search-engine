People seem to think we're just desperate for ideas and will steal any that come our way.  And 9 times out of 10, it's not even an original idea. Usually in the form of \"like Facebook but...\" or \"like Instagram with\" or something like that.\n\nI recently had someone from accounting at work ask me \"how hard it is to learn how to make apps\". When I asked why, they had an idea that they wouldn't tell me anything about, just that they knew it was a good one and didn't want anyone doing it first.\n\nSorry for the diversion. I'm not sure of any private code-review services out there; it seems like a very niche service.", "id": "e4z2jmu", "replies": []}, {"body": "Code review as a service is an interesting idea, for sure. I'm not aware of any place that does that explicitly but I'm sure you could reach out to a consulting company and they could negotiate something. I imagine it'll be expensive.\n\nSomething I see quite often with people starting a company or venture is this fear that people will steal your idea. I hate to say it but there are a never ending parade of ideas and they don't really have much value. The value comes from the implementation and doing it well. \n\nWhat happens when you go to market? Someone might clone your idea. Maybe someone generates a similar idea on their own, who knows. \n\nI know you are not likely to change your relative's mind on this, but keep an eye out and you will see this idea fear repeating over and over with New comers.\n\nGood luck!", "id": "e4z6yjn", "replies": []}], "title": "Where to Get a Completely Confidential Review of My Code"}
