I am focusing on the media-track of IT that the school offers (as in video editing, digital effects, computer modelling/animation, etc.). Before I came here, I completed my \"gen eds\" at a community college. I took no coding classes there, nor when I was in high school. I took a class that teaches C programming my first semester here. I had a little rough time with it. Afterwards, I took the second level of the course, but I dropped out of it due to how terrible the structure and professor were (as many people were saying how infamous it was). When that happened, I did not want to code anymore, but I had to take that class as a requirement for IT. When I dropped though, I found out that a new IT class was created that would count towards the second-level course that I dropped and it was less-intensive with coding as it was for media IT students. I took that and it taught JS and C#, but at the beginning, I did not like coding still and was just going to take the class just for the requirement. After the midterm, I started realizing that I think I do want to get into coding, but I struggled with the content, but got a B+ as the professor is very chill with grading. So now, I took all of the possible classes here that teach a language from the start.\n\nNow, I want to learn C, C#, and Python. I know Python is known as the best first language for one to learn, so here is my question. Is Udemy great for learning coding and getting to the professional-level of coding or at least close to it? I would like to take its Python course, but I want to make sure that it is REALLY good at teaching it first. I thank you in advance.", "score": 5, "comments": [{"body": "Udemy is hit and miss.
