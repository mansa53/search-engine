But you need to know some theory about how to store and access information quickly.\n\nThe big hint for this is to break the data into word and store them in a map, btree you can also map the words back to sentences and the original data. Pretty much it sounds like an indexing problem. The guy probably wants you to make your own hash table implementation for this. From that point you basically nail questions 1, 2, 4, 5, 6.\n\n7, 8, 9 can use the hash map but require additional processing using the original data. Which you stored a list of index's to when you build the hash map so you can check that the following word is also present.\n\nYou can also compute 3 in much the same way by having a list of index's to the start of the original sentences. So when you search across the map you look for the most common sentence on the word.\n\nNote... The question specifically forbids you from using say std::map in c++. So.... therefore you make your own which is really part of the goal here. Or use a vector with sequential search, Or binary search and keep it sorted every time you add an item. Or roll your own btree.\n\nSo you end up with a structure that looks like this\n\nstruct MyStruct {\n  int Count;\n  std::list<int> OriginalLocation;\n  std::list<int> OriginalSentanceLocation;\n};\n\nstd::map<std::string, MyStruct> DataIndex;\n\nSo for \"Hi. Hello World World\"\n\nLooks like\n\n\"Hi\" -> { 1, 0, 0};\n\"Hello\" -> { 1, { 5 }, { 5 }};\n\"World\" -> { 2, { 11, 17 }, { 5, 5 }};\n\nSo for occurrences of \"World\". I can immediately look at the map and return 2; I an also find out how many times it occurred in the same sentence by using the list. But I can also check \"World\" followed \"Hello\" by using the original data and just doing a string compare on it.\n\n\n", "id": "e5cfsnz", "replies": [{"body": "I totally forgot to mention !

Often in these exercises the restrictions are the question that needs solved.\n\nIts kinda odd trying to explain it. But there is multiple goals. The obvious one is to build an index around the data. The other goal is to make it run fast.\n\nThe thing about a map is that it basically has insert, find, erase functions which are all you need. You can represent these using your own code. If that happens to sequentially search a list then so be it. But you can also change the sequential search later to use a btree or a hash.\n\nOne of the reasons why I was asking for your solution was I would be able to tell almost exactly what experience you have and what problems your are hitting from the signatures in your code.
