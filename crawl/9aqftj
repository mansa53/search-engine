I would like to think of this more like a discussion. I am taking a Software Testing & QA course and we have a project for the course. The instructions we have been given is to test some piece of software. The instructor went into a bit more detail and said we could test open source software. This begs the question, what open source software would be good to test given 1 semester to complete the testing. I find it hard to believe that testing Ubuntu, GIMP, or Apache HTTP Server (big open source software) would be doable in a semester. I could be wrong on this and if so please inform me. Are there smaller, somewhat popular, open source software that would be better?", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "Peruse Github's most cloned maybe?  Does it have to be a full program?  What about a library or utility?  Does it have to have 100% code coverage?  What about various GNU tools/utilities?  What language are you wanting?  There's a lot out there, so it'd help if you narrowed things down some.  But mostly, peruse Github, find something that looks cool that you'd like to learn the ins and outs of, and test that.  Hell, is the instructor ok if  you commit your tests if the project doesn't already have any?  It might be worth trying to provide tests so you can put down an open source contribution on your resume.", "id": "e4yd86c", "replies": []}], "title": "What is a good open source software to run software testing tools on?"}
