{"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9bmfa8/pricing_and_data_storage/", "text": "So recently I've started to delve into the data storage aspect of programming - learning/becoming proficient at SQL, determining between Google, Amazon, Microsoft for data storage options, exploring projects that deal with big-data, etc.  \n\n  One thing I always come across is pricing - even though it is explained, I can't really wrap my head around how a cost is determined for storing data. From what I can gather, its pay as you go, depending on users pulling from the data storage, how often its being done, and the amount of storage you need.  \n\n  I still feel like I'm not correct and I'm worried about racking up charges because I was an idiot and played around too much. Is there anywhere that has an ELI5 of how data storage is priced, and what range I could expect to be in? The current stuff I'm working with is just above not being able to fit into a Google Sheet, but nothing absurdly large.  \n\n  Any additional resources that you would personally recommend for learning all the ins and outs of dealing with data (who you chose to store data with, good learning materials, etc.) would be greatly appreciated.", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "* What type of data are you storing? \n* How often do you need to read or write to It? \n* Do you need redundancy?\n\nThere are many more possible factors. But the point being it's not as simple as a pricing tier chart. The price will vary wildly depending on your industry and your use case.\n", "id": "e546z73", "replies": [{"body": "First off, thanks for the reply!\n\n* I'm just looking to store pure text data formatted as JSON\n* It will most likely only be edited/written to 10-20 times a day at the most, read maybe 50 times at the most - but it will happen daily at a consistent pace\n* Most likely - the information is sensitive and would be an issue if lost. I was under the impression though going through a service like Google Cloud would take care of this issue?\n\nI suppose what I'm looking for was a general ball park - just to get a rough idea of budget.

If it's a real issue and you can't trust the provider you would use your own server on-premises. Otherwise you would go for a dedicated server or a VPS.\n\nExpect to pay around $10/month for normal, no-frills hosting. If you're asking for redundancy and other extras it can go as high as $20/month but that's in the extreme.", "id": "e54h5de", "replies": []}]}]}], "title": "Pricing and data storage"}
