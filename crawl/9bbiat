As such, I wanted to give back. I was originally going to make a udemy course, but decided that perhaps a live-stream would be more beneficial for people whom are getting their feet wet in the world of programming.\n\n\u200b\n\nSo, I am thinking about putting together a small series of live-streaming to get people into it. When I finally started college, in my programming courses, my fellow students said that I had a knack for making things easy to understand.\n\n\u200b\n\nOverall, the languages don't matter too terribly much, but you can vote on which language I use from the list below.\n\nC#\n\nJava - 2 votes\n\nPython\n\nC\n\n\u200b\n\nI want to remind people that this is for COMPLETE BEGINNERS. I will cover the basics. You can ask me questions too if you  do not understand something. I don't know if I can link my twitch account, but if I can; I'll update the post. (I'm also open to covering other languages if another is more requested). I would like to do the stream during this weekend. 12:00 PM EST (GMT - 5) (East coast United States time)\n\n\u200b\n\nPlease let me know if this is something that someone would like :)", "score": 7, "comments": [{"body": "I would not be able to watch the stream livd at 12pm because of my work schedule but I would LOVE to watch it recorded.

I know the fundamentals but would enjoy listening in once it gets a little further beyond that. Like if you talk about actual implementation, using git, and other stuff like that.

If you jump on the stream and ask about actual implementation, then I can answer questions surrounding that as well. The main goal of this is to give someone a person to talk to live.
