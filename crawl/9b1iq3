I've personally used it to teach kids and it's a What You See Is What You Get type block programming. It's better for kids because they can instantly see feed back. Aka, you put 1 block down and the avatar moves. Put 2 down, and now it's walking off screen, etc.\n\nThere are other similar options, but block programming like this is usually a great way to go.", "id": "e4zmzn2", "replies": [{"body": "I think this is a better way of doing things for someone that is 9. But I also would highly recommend using normal coding. That away the kid doesn't think block coding is real world stuff. I can't stand college classes that has block coding for the entire class. In my opinion, it should only be the first week or 2 and then you move on to real world stuff. I've personally seen people messed over from that.", "id": "e4zqv35", "replies": [{"body": "What 9 year old will get messed up by doing block programming for more than 2 weeks? Personally, if you showed a child Scratch, they can and will get very involved with it. Then you took it away and forced them to write things that they probably still haven't mastered in scratch. That would kill any joy they have of programming.\n\nHow do I know this? I taught children how to program using Scratch. These same children then wound up in my more advanced class the next year which was basic Python. They failed miserably and hated every second of it. All they had the attention span for was Scratch. I had a couple students who I immediately moved down back to Scratch because that's what they enjoyed, and were actually learning. \n\nFor the kids who really love programming, and have a solid understanding of the basics, middle school is a good age to transition to \"real world stuff\". High school is the age where it's easier to start kids from 0 programming to normal programming languages.\n\nKids should always start with something that feels fun, and keeps their attention. This way, they learn important problem solving skills without thinking they're learning. It gets them excited and they want to work on stuff outside the classroom. \n\nLastly, kids are also smarter than you think. You show them how block programming is similar, but different to \"real world stuff\" early on, it sets expectations for them. They understand these expectations and will know that they're learning something useful, but it's still different from what they'll be doing in a few years if they want to continue programming.", "id": "e4zsk9k", "replies": [{"body": "> What 9 year old will get messed up by doing block programming for more than 2 weeks?

It has been a while since I messed with block programming so I can't think of any names off the top of my head. \n\nAnyways, the last part of the previous post wasn't about kids. I'm doing a 4 year degree right now that I'm about to get done with. While my degree is in networks and cyber security. All the coding classes I've had during my current and prior degrees were 100% block. In fact, I was taking an Android dev class during a prior degree while I was writing actual Android apps on my own time. I was the only one there (including the teacher) that could write a single Android app outside of block. Several tried to from what was shown in class and they flat out couldn't. They didn't even know what eclipse was or Android studio. None of them even heard of them", "id": "e4zt936", "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Not sure how intense you want to start but I\u2019d recommend looking into scratch by mit as the language.", "id": "e4zmzvf", "replies": []}, {"body": "MIT app inventor is a kid friendly introduction to the logic side.
