I've been looking at it for about an hour now and not sure how to approach it. At what point would you decide to look at a solution?", "score": 4, "comments": [{"body": "Depends. At least a few hours. The longest I worked on a problem was three full days. I find that if I vow to not look up the solution I am more likely to find it myself. You have to build confidence and skill by actually solving problem yourself if you wanna get good at it.", "id": "e4yhnru", "replies": []}, {"body": "I try for 20-30 min. If I'm not close to an answer by then, I peek and make sure I understand the logic. But have you studied dynamic programming before?

I've done dynamic programming briefly in my analysis of algorithm class, so far the only example I've seen is memoization of the fib algorithm.
