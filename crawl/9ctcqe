It's certainly not been my experience. The only people I know who have struggled to get into the industry either have unrealistic expectations (e.g. being a mediocre developer and only applying for Google-tier companies), want to work in niche industries such as games development, or want to work in high pressure environments (again, games) while only wanting to commit to a 9-5 day with no overtime.", "id": "e5d9au6", "replies": []}, {"body": "If you think it's hard to get a job as  CS grad try having any other education that's not as in demand.\n\nIt's really not hard for CS grads to get jobs.
