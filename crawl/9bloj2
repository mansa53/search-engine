My task is to write a web app which the users of the company can use to write, edit and upload their resume. These resumes must also be stored and  retrieved from a database that I'll have to create. While I'm responsible for getting this done, I will be helped here and there since I'm still a student. Now I was wondering what would be a good way  to get into web development. I have around 1 year experience in Java and also some C# experience. I have looked around on Udemy and found [Colt Steel's Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).   It looks like a good course but my friend says that it covers way too much for my goal, which also makes sense. It must be said though that we both know more about languages like Java and C# and I was wondering how you guys would approach this.\n\nJump all on it with a 40+ hour course or be more precise in what you decide  to  learn and what not, if so, what course or guide would you recommend me?  Also which tools (for building the web app) and languages would be useful for a task like this? I don't mind learning a lot at once but I  also don't know if overflooding myself with information on a new  subject is a good idea.\n\nThanks in advance!", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": "I think you should go for the udemy course. As you will get everything there and  you will not waste time searching which stuff to learn. Also you have to invest time on something you really want to learn. You will not be  able to clear the basis if you  take the shortcuts. And as web development is growing nowadays ,it will be good for you to learn these skills which will help you in future.

It would be good for you to read a bit about them and see simple examples. Please do not bother going into debates into which is better at this point. Web devs looove those debates. Either ask around which is preferred or pick the one you understand the most.\n- deploy another app using the library you choose and slowly keep adding stuff\n\nGoogle will be your friend for a good week or two, but you should pick up on it pretty fast since you already code :)", "id": "e54izvc", "replies": []}], "title": "Need advice on how to build proper web apps."}
