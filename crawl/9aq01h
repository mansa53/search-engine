I\u2019m about to move into the first section on Ruby and I\u2019m having second thoughts. I see often a lot of people saying that Ruby and Ruby on Rails is more niche these days and that perhaps something like node.js would be a better backend language to start with. I also hear people arguing back that that is not really the case and Ruby has a lot of life left.  \nI have really enjoyed The Odin Project, I think it is super well constructed and informative and I really like a lot of things about it. I am just not sure about Ruby and since I\u2019m older and new to programming I don\u2019t want to waste my time and not have ample job opportunities right away.  \nWhat are your thoughts? Should I stick with it or bounce around? Maybe Free Code Camp? My main concern really is not having a focused Plath to follow if I leave.

I prefer Freecodecamp because I like their structure. But that is just my opinion. Do whatever you like. Odin Project is a good resource to learn.", "id": "e4x6wqe", "replies": [{"body": "Thanks maybe I\u2019ll take a look at free code camp and double down on the basics. Before stepping into backend and it will give me some time to see what the local companies are lookin for. ", "id": "e4x7mrs", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "What is your goal? If it is to learn to program for your own ideas, I\u2019d say continue. You will find that once you learn a programming language well, it is easier to learn other languages. It is the key concepts that are important. Languages move in and out of fashion but the fundamentals remain the same. \n\nIf it is to get a job, look at job openings in your area. Find a job you like and work towards meeting the requirements. This will allow you to develop a plan to work with and give you a better idea of your next move, or the kinds of questions to ask. If you like ruby and there are openings or companies around you that use ruby, keep going :)", "id": "e4x70z4", "replies": [{"body": "Great thank you! I\u2019ll keep my eye on the local listings and see if there are any companies asking for Ruby or to see what they are mostly asking for.  \n\nMy goals are to work for a local company at first and really learn the ropes and work flow.
