I was lucky enough to be offered a gift of 10k off if I take Lambda, which is making it tough to decide.. If you've got any feedback, I'd love to hear it.** \n\n*  At a glance, simply by hours of instruction, Lambda seems to teach more topics and has significantly more hours of instruction per cost, and they stress that they engage Comp Sci topics more (which may or may not improve outcomes.)\n*  Lambda's outcomes (for Median Avg. Income) are ~8k lower than HRR but they argue that reporting results are unreliable from their industry. (While this may be true, being part of self-regulating body, would at least make results - even if skewed- more comparable, which is pro-consumer, and also they could push for reform or audits within CIRR- not being part of CIRR feels like a cop-out in some ways.) (Edit: See cofounder remarks below on this.)\n* Anecdotally, you don't see a lot of negative reviews or positive review from HR alumn, where there is both more post volume of neg and positive reviews of LS on Reddit.\n\n* Hypothetically, if I had two programs of equivalent curriculum, but one offered an ISA and the other was upfront only - I would expect to have less confident students in the latter, and that might affect outcomes in job searches. I wish Lambda reported the full range like CIRR did - so you'd see the curve of common results more readily.\n\nHack Reactor Remote | Lambda School Comp Sci + Web Dev (Always Remote)\n---|---\n3 Months (12 Weeks) | 6 Months (30 weeks)\n8 Hr Days | 8 Hr Days\n4 Days a Week | 5 Days a Week\n~384 Hrs Total | ~1200 Hrs Total\nMost recently reported  6-month window cohort hiring %: 70% | Most recent reported 6 month window from Lambda (cohort 1) 83%\n$17,980 Tuition | [ISA](https://lambdaschool.com/courses/cs/web/) or 20K Tuition\nOlder, more established program | New, YCombinator Company\nReports to [CIRR](https://cirr.org/)* | Hasn't reported to CIRR yet, may not**\nReported *$78,020* Median Annual Base Salary for HRR to CIRR | Per interview, *$70,000* Median Annual Base Salary\n[Syllabus](https://www.hackreactor.com/remote-immersive/) Javascript, Angular, Node, MongoDB, Express, React, Backbone, opt.

Your comment on CIRR conflicts with answer I received from your staff, but comports with what you answered on Reddit previously.

These products may serve different niches effectively.\n\nI do want to argue that the Outcomes page is not totally CIRR equivalent, for instance: \n\n* \"Cohort 1: 83% Hired 6 months into searching\n* Cohort 2:  56% Hired 5 months into searching\n* Cohort 3: 64% Hired 4 months into searching\n* Cohort 4: 48% Hired 3 months into searching\"\n\nMakes it confusing to compare because you are altering the search-time, and it seems to argue that in a good way, more are getting hired more quickly, but that isn't an equivalent structure to CIRR (3 and 6-month search window presented per cohort)", "id": "e55y2mq", "replies": [{"body": "Ya, we wanted to provide *more* information than CIRR as we would only have one cohort worth at six months (the 83%).
