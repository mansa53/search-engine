How can this be done?\n\nHi there.  I searched high and low for an answer to this, and either didn't understand the results, or missed something extremely obvious if it exists, so my apologies.\n\n# Context:\n\nI have a website I'm working on for a podcast I run ([link to the website](https://notoriousrpg.com)).  It's currently deployed on github pages using a bootstrap theme that I've adapted and has a few js files added in for some minimal number crunching.  The homepage is a list of our current episodes, but when ever we release one, I manually update a js file that then injects the info into the index.html.  It's sloppy, but it works.\n\nI'd like to follow better practices, so I'm trying to get the website to read directly from the podcast rss feed so that it is updated automatically.  However, I've tried doing that without 3rd party tools and constantly run into a \"*No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.* \"  This is because the rss feed doesn't allow resources that it doesn't share a server with access to it's info.  It's dumb. But I have no way to change it.\n\nI found this npm package called [rss-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rss-parser) that works around this error by creating a proxy and tricking the feed into thinking it's being requested by the same server.  I'd like to use the package (since it's tested and works), but my project is not a node js project.  I have node installed on my machine however, and have done some minimal work in node, however I've never converted a basic into a node project and I'm wondering if there's a right way to do it, or is it really just as easy as typing in \"npm install -g\" on my project?", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "I could be misunderstanding, but it sounds like you might be confused about the difference between front-end and back-end.\n\nIt sounds like the site you have right now is 100% front-end. That means that the web browser downloads all of your html, css, and javascript, and it runs the javascript locally. That's why you're hitting some limitations - because javascript running in a browser has some limitations on what it's allowed to do.\n\nNode.js is a back-end technology. It doesn't get downloaded by the browser. It runs on a web server. When the user visits your page, the back-end fires up and runs your node.js code. Your node.js code **outputs** the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that's actually downloaded by the web browser. What this lets you do is dynamically change the HTML that the user receives from the server, every time.\n\nYou can't mix and match Node.js code that runs on the server, like rss-parser, with JavaScript code that runs inside your page, stuff that's included by a <script> tag in your HTML. They're completely different and incompatible, other than the fact that they're both written in JavaScript.\n\nSo here's what you need to do to make this work:\n\n1. Find a place to host your site that can run Node.js. GitHub pages won't work, you'll have to use a paid host.\n2. Do some Node.js tutorials and learn how to get it to serve a basic web page, and have it add some dynamic content based on a template\n3. Figure out rss-parser and integrate it the way you want it\n4. Consider doing some caching so that your site doesn't fetch the RSS feed every time someone visits your page\n5. Now put all of the pieces together\n6. Upload the site to your host\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "e4y2tkz", "replies": [{"body": "This is amazingly helpful.
