{"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9ajphs/hi_anyone_that_can_help_me_with_this_challenge_i/", "text": "  \n\nI\u2019m working in a case with a customer that is hosting a web site for tech events. Specifically, the web site exposes a page that lists all events, including some basic information related to the events (event title, technology, starting date and registration link). The site is an MVC 4 web application running on a hosting platform with a maximum allowed quota of 512 MB, and the event list is implemented with the DataTables jQuery plug-in (version 1.9.4) which is configured in server-side mode.\n\nAfter adding MVC 4\u2019s output cache using cache profiles on the MVC action that lists the events, the site got suspended because the memory usage quota for the website was reached. We restarted it and eventually it went down again.\n\nDuring our local debugging sessions we found that the site's memory usage surpasses the maximum allowed quota. We are now testing the site with only 10000 events but the issue is still occurring.\n\nIf it\u2019s helpful in any way, the following is the cache profile configuration defined in the [web.config](http://web.config/):\n\n*<caching>* \n\n*<outputCacheSettings>*\n\n*<outputCacheProfiles>* \n\n*<add name=\"CacheEvents\" duration=\"3600\" varyByParam=\"iDisplayStart iDisplayLength;sSearch\" />* \n\n*</outputCacheProfiles>*\n\n*</outputCacheSettings>* \n\n*</caching>*\n\nCan you reproduce this, explain what the cause is, and provide a fix?", "score": 2, "comments": [], "title": "Hi!
