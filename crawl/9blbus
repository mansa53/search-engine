My problem is that I have no knowledge of programming, coding etc. My SO has some knowledge with a background in IT, but obvs has a life. With very limited funds is it a possibility for me to teach myself programming and build the site, MApp etc. or what does Reddit suggest I do with my idea? \n\nOne possibility was to share my idea, offer a share of the final entity in return for your skills. (I hope this isn\u2019t breaking the rules)\n\n\nAppreciate all the help in advance and sorry if this had been done all wrong! \n", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "> One possibility was to share my idea,\n\nGet a patent first", "id": "e53tgce", "replies": []}, {"body": "It is difficult to comment.

Although I guess it depends on what you're trying to make.\n\nYour other option is collaboration, but you're gonna have a hella hard time with that. Everyone already has their \"big idea\" and are struggling with the effort part just like you, especially in web development.
