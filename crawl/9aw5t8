I recently practiced my python abilities by scraping a website to retrieve data but i didn't read their terms of service before doing so. It is explicitly stated that scraping their service is a complete violation of their TOS. Reading this, I promptly removed the data, as well as deleted my scraper. I ran it for a total of 5 times. Anyways, i just wanted to know what the legal ramifications are as a result of this? Im not sure whether or not to send the company an apology email explaining my poor judgement.

It places more traffic burden on your site at the expense of actual customers.\n\n2. Possibly scraping bots can steal your data.\n\n\\#1 is probably the more relevant problem, since \\#2 can be done by humans as well, albeit at a smaller scale. With \\#1, if you are using a web site to practice scraping, it will also be especially annoying, because your bots will probably have bugs and not be efficient, and you will want to test them over and over on the same web site. Not very good for a web site operator. If you want to do it for practice it would be better to create a local web server on your own machine and practice on that. Then no one will care.\n\n\"Scraping\" can mean many things and some of them are completely normal. For example Google routinely downloads pages from the Internet in order to index it. If your page changes often and is popular, you will get \"scraped\" by Google more often; if you look at your logs you can see this. The difference is, Google's bots are designed to download as little data as possible, to respect the robots.txt file, etc. \n\nFinally, remember that terms of service are not laws and you have to read each of them with a grain of salt. Try to give each term the respect that it deserves. For example, I could put up a web site and write into the terms that Google is not allowed to index my site. Do you think they would respect that term?\n", "id": "e4ykz42", "replies": [{"body": "He can also put a counter on it and make it stop by 20 requests", "id": "e4z541x", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "> It is explicitly stated that scraping their service is a complete violation of their TOS. ... i just wanted to know what the legal ramifications are as a result of this?

The legal ramifications if any are much harder to answer. Most likely, nothing will happen at all. If you are scraping a lot (like gigabytes of data every day), what normally happens if you take things too far is that you will be temporarily or permanently blocked from accessing the site at all. Some sites like Google try to detect bots and put up a \"Captcha\" form randomly in order to confuse them or stop them in their tracks.\n\nIn extreme cases, in theory, the operator could subpoena your service provider to find out who you are and send you a cease and desist letter, threaten you with legal fees, etc. But this would be very extreme, and they would almost certainly need more than a terms of service in order to successfully sue you.\n", "id": "e4ylrea", "replies": [{"body": "Thank you so much for all your clarifications!", "id": "e4yltwh", "replies": []}, {"body": "> temporarily or permanently blocked from accessing the site\n\nYep, that's the general legal extend.
