I can do a bit of java, i only had a beginners course in my first semester. I know objects and classes, but i didnt dive into it too deep. I wanna get better. I decided to program chess so i learn by doing stuff. However, i have a hard time to start programming it - i dont know what approach to take, as i know how to design the piece classes but i fail to understand how to make it all visual and let the pieces interact with the board etc. I would like to either trying to do it with another guy who is currently at my level of knowledge, to discuss stuff etc. Or if someone would be willing to teach me and help me a bit on my way, that would also be great. \n\nIf it goes far we can also try to make an AI to implement it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know there are a lot of tutorials out there, but i think talking about code and not just following videos is helping me more.  \n\n\nTLDR; anyone wanna join/help me code chess?
