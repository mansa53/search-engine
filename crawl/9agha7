Which people often go to school specifically for, it's a whole field by itself. And HTML/CSS is going to be a tiny fraction of the skills needed for those jobs, so HTML/CSS aren't going to be what they need to brush up on for an interview. It'd be like saying \"does anyone need to brush up on their hammer and nail skills?\". Sure, carpenters need hammer and nail skills, but that's not what carpenters do. HTML and CSS are so simple to learn too, that if a marketing department does have a need for modifying that content (I.E. a webmaster), I've often seen someone in the marketing department just take it up. Knowing nothing except HTML/CSS is not going to get you a job these days. You don't necessarily need to know how to program, but you need to know *something* else.\n\nAlso, as to your comment below, HTML and CSS are not programming languages. There are not \"declarative languages\" as you said. SQL is a declarative language. HTML is a \"markup language.\" It doesn't \"tell the computer to do anything\", it simply describes the layout of where stuff is. It's the web engine that tells the computer what to do. If HTML is a programming language, then so is Microsoft Word. There's really no difference between Microsoft Word and HTML except for the level of complexity. \n\nSomeone applying for some front end developer jobs might want some help brushing up on HTML and CSS. No one is arguing that they aren't important skills to learn. But if you think that there are still jobs out there for just that or if you think they're \"programming languages\", then it's simply my personal opinion that you're not yet at the level where you should be mentoring other people.

What is a CSS framework?", "id": "e4vh5c5", "replies": [{"body": "My responses with my current knowledge:\n\n1.  I'm not 100% sure, but if I had to guess, I would say HTML element is just an abstract term for the different tags.  Such as <p>, <body>, <table>, etc.\n\n2.  (And 3) DOM stands for Document Object Model.  It's how the browser stores the web page.  HTML is the skeleton of the DOM, CSS is the skin and Javascript is the muscles.  You manipulate the DOM with Javascript.\n\n3. Bootstrap is a framework to make the web page responsive.  Ergo it maintains the same look and feel on different screen sizes.  Bootstrap uses a grid system to layout the width of various elements on different screen sizes.\n\n4.  No idea what foundation is.  \n\n5. They make CSS frameworks?  I know about things like flex-box; is that a CSS framework?  \n\nMy responses after researching each item:\n\n1.  HTML element is the thing the browser renders after parsing the html tag and css for said tag. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#Elements_vs._tags)\n\n2.  Closly related to 3.  DOM provides us an easy way to change the HTML and to change the CSS of an HTML element.  Ergo...we can add/edit/remove elements and change their look and feel using DOM.\n\n3.  DOM stands for Document Object Model.  It is the interface used to describe HTML and XML web pages.  DOM represents documents as nodes and objects and provides a way for programming languages (such as Javascript) to connect to and manipulate various nodes and objects. [Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction).  You can actually talk about what DOM is for quite some time because it's such a big topic.  There are various sources from MDN, Mozilla, W3Schools, Wikipedia that can help with understanding of what DOM exactly *is*.\n\n4.  Hit the nail on the head with 1st response.\n\n5.  It's a responsive front-end [framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(framework\\)).\n\n6.  Bootstrap is technically considered a CSS framework.  I, personally, consider it a web framework...because it has features like buttons and textboxes and not just built in css code (like colors and width).  But I guess it technically should be called a CSS framework.\n\n\nThe most important thing to note here is that knowing this information *during* the interview and getting the correct answer isn't half as important as being able to research and determine the answers yourself and actually *implement* them to build a product.\n\nUnfortunately, I have done a lot of interviews where the interviewer values the former.  I just use that as a red flag that I don't want to work for that company.  But when an interviewer will ask me how I would go about determining the answer if I had Google, now I know they are actually interested in me and know how to code in the real world.", "id": "e4vpila", "replies": []}, {"body": "I like this one.
