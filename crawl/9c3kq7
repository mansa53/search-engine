I would really appreciate the help.\nThank you!", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "You should really think about what the requirements are. What can the existing program do? Do you want to maintain full feature parity? How will yours be better? Do you need the program to run on specific platforms? Does it need network or web access? Does your company have an existing infrastructure for such programs? \n\nThese are some of things you should think about before you even consider a language or think about software design.\n\nAlso, you may want to talk to your boss about the idea first to get the go ahead. And input from your coworkers about they would like to see.", "id": "e57qf87", "replies": [{"body": "Yes, I should have mentioned in my post that I have considered all this and am in the process of deciding which features to keep and which to remove.

If it's a desktop app, then Java, C++, or C# would also be good options, depending on what you need to do. \n\nSo unless you can provide that info, you'll likely be getting a very wide variety of suggestions that may not actually be suitable for your use cases.", "id": "e57r7w0", "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Sure, what platform is it gonna run on.

So you might start by making a diagram like [this](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/618/OOP-and-UML). Really think through all the required relationships. Then think through use cases which are things a user would do (like \"Add a new client\" or \"Create a work order associated with a client\") and think through an interface. You want to make sure each use case is possible and not overly complex to execute. I know that all sounds boring and academic, but you'll be amazed how seemingly simple things can spiral out of control over time. \n\nIf you compile some professional documents like this, you might be able to show your boss and get them to let you allocate x% of your work time to it, that's always worth a shot. \n\nThen you actually need to program it, in corporate environments you kind of have to ignore all the exciting tech and just pick something that's easy to create GUIs for and will run on a lot of computers. As much as I don't like working in it, I would probably use Java for this with an IDE to help with GUI layout. \n\nThen prepare for the most annoying pushback of your life. Non-technical people think about computer tasks in terms of steps (often literal steps written on some frequently-lost scrap of paper). They complain about software, then you fix their complaint and they can't use it because \"my paper says press 'Next' but the only button on this screen says 'Continue' \".
