How far do you think I can get?\nAt the moment, I am 17. So, I still have university.\n\nBut, I want to get with a top tech company in Germany. At the moment, I live in Canada.\n\nSo, do you think that in 6 more years, I can get in with a top tech company in Germany (Google, FB, Amazon, etc)?\n\nOh, and I have been programming for one year so far, and I know: HTML, a bit of JS, and a bit of Python.\n\nThanks everyone!!", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "You can for sure. You could do it in less. Top companies love to invest in young smart people like yourself. \n\n1. Believe in yourself\n2. Set your goals and achieve them\n3. Prepare to fail. Not every plan will succeed. Learn from it. Reflect. \n4. Read. Internet makes us dumb. Get the most out of your education.\n5. Time. Put in time. Like 12 hours a day and then some. Become a master.\n6. Work on your social skills. You\u2019er going to need those in order to be accepted by the normies. \n\nSource: self educated freelance software dev.
