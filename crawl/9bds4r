A bit of backstory is that I've toyed with the idea of creating an interactive galaxy for a role-playing community I'm apart of where users can scroll in to get information on planets, occupants, etc. I tried to think of ways it could be done but couldn't figure it out with the (*limited*) knowledge I have.\n\n\u200b\n\n...And then a member of said community sends me this: [https://galacticatlas.nomanssky.com/](https://galacticatlas.nomanssky.com/)\n\n\u200b\n\nWow. So now I'm back at the start with a new drive to create it as I've always planned, and I'm turning to any information that can help point me in the right direction for learning to create something similar to this! I'm not even sure what language is used or how to create anything of this nature inside of a web page, but after inspecting the code it seems like it uses a meta tag to pick up an \"application\".\n\n\u200b\n\nThanks so much if you can give me some insight as to what I need to do to learn to make things like this!", "score": 3, "comments": [{"body": "Real talk: if you don't understand what meta tags do then this is way, way, way outside of your ability.  Start with something much smaller and go from there.\n\nAs for where to start, check out the FAQ in the sidebar ---->\n\nAlso check out /r/webdev.\n\nGood luck!", "id": "e52c33j", "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the heads up rjcarr, I'll make sure I check what you've mentioned out!", "id": "e536bmy", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I don't know if that website specifically is using it, but I have seen from [Daniel Shiffman's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqiKWXUX-o8) videos that you can use [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) in JavaScript to make 3D and 2D graphics in websites.
