I renamed them to start with an uppercase letter (File.js) and followed [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10523849/changing-capitalization-of-filenames-in-git) (changed ignorecase to false inside the local config git file of the project).\n\n\u200b\n\nThis worked fine. However, after pushing to Github, I got two files which are the same, besides their naming (file.js and File.js). What would be an elegant way to get rid of the \"old\" files, starting with a lowercase letter, so I would only keep the ones starting with an uppercase letter?\n\n\u200b\n\nThanks.", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Git doesn't stop tracking those old files.
