I think registry changes for settings like that only take effect on startup or login instead of immediately.\n\nScripting a change to the setting so that it takes effect immediately may require interacting with a DLL or even the Win32 API. I expect doing that to be much harder than scripting a registry change. Googling \u201cpinvoke\u201d is a good way to start your research.\n\nFinally, while Python should work just fine, you might find these actions slightly easier to script in C++, C#, or Powershell.", "id": "e4tjgdk", "replies": [{"body": "PInvoke is the interop system for .NET, it wouldn't apply to Python unless you use IronPython (Python build on .NET, which can call arbitrary .NET functions).
