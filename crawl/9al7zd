I wrote couple of programs such as hospital, school automation etc... Basically one code adopted to different environments. I used visual basic. But forgot it all since this was in 2005. Since then, I moved to US and was focus on surviving, so I didnt do any programming. Studied in college here again programming. Learned pythong and java. Wrote couple of basic programs and class project. But then got a girlfriend which turned into wife and got 2 kids and full time jobs.\n\n\u200b\n\nCurrently I am a network engineer, mid 30s. I got a good job at the biggest Wireless carrier in US. I am not looking to switch career, but trying to add programming/scripting into my portfolio since programming is becoming part of networking as well. My main goal is to do some project related to part of my job where you read the webpage, take the info write it to a file, compare it to previous version and email if there is a different. This is my goal to make it happen as my first project where it will make life easier within my team.\n\n\u200b\n\nI use linux as my desktop and know how to get around in linux(almost ready to pass redhat admin exam.).\n\n\u200b\n\nSo currently refreshing my memory with codecademy. I should be done in 1-2 weeks with major topics.\n\n\u200b\n\nSo enough of background...\n\nI have a few questions or some topics I need advise.\n\n\u200b\n\n1- My problem was always how to think like a coder. When someone tells me like step by step do this, do that and I can do it easily. But when I think myself, it is hard to start to the project or come up with a logic to implement it. How can I think like a programmer? Do I need I need to refresh my math skills to be more efficient? any tips\n\n\u200b\n\n2- Also what did you do wrong when you started and you would differently if you were starting over?\n\n\u200b\n\n3- What editor do you use? I use notepad++ at work computer. But use At", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": "The easiest way to start is do some automation using python. As you are working a network engineer you may have to do some steps on a day-to-day basis, you can start automate those in Python. Regarding the IDE part I generally use PyCharm Professional but there is a Community edition as well. The advantage of using IDE is many-fold, I find it mostly useful during refactoring the code. If you are just a beginner you can use Atom/ Sublime and use proper plug-ins for enhancing Python developer experience. Youtube will be a good resource for customizing those.", "id": "e4wa1ne", "replies": []}], "title": "just starting to learn python(once again), what should I learn a right way this time?"}
