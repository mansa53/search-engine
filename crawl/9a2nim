Program software in terms of displaying audio information on a screen (Levels, Sends, EQ, etc....)\n2. Learn how electronics and computer software interact with one another. \n3. Online classes, certifications or DIY projects that are specifically related to audio and software programming that will give me a better grasp on how the hardware of a audio console interacts with the software. \n\nI've been trying to google literature based on electronics and software programming in the audio world, but i'm not seeing anything super related to the topic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks\n\n ", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "You're working on a kite and asking about building a single prop airplane. Not impossible, just very expensive and probably a few projects down the road. \n\nYou're going to need to know about embedded systems and mixed signal circuits, I'd start with an Arduino and LED bar graph on a bread board for your preamp. Then replace the gain control with a digital pot controlled by an encoder. \n\nAnd so on and so forth. Try making a 3 band EQ, a gate, maybe even a compressor or limiter. \n\nRealistically you could build a single or 2 channel channel strip controlled by software. Once you get into more channels you're talking about serious money. But by then youll know more about where to search for information you need. \n\nThere's a few massive roadblocks to building a console with the features you're talking about. But you'll learn about those once you get a few projects under your belt. ", "id": "e4see2w", "replies": [{"body": "Sweet, thanks for the insight!
