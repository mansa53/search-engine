I've been learning about React.js and I built a portfolio website. In the my \"contact me\" section, I built a form component so anyone interested in getting in touch can simply leave their contact info.\n\nWhere should I host this website? There's no need for server rendering since it's all single page, however I'd need the form's 'onSubmit' event to trigger some kind of function/action. I'd ideally like this to send a formatted email to my personal email address containing the info that the form held when it was submitted. \n\nSorry for the ignorance, I'm trying to research this but at this point I'm not really sure what I should be researching!\n\nAlso I'd like to use amazon web services if it's right since I'd like to learn the tech. I see a lot of job descriptions asking for AWS experience", "score": 7, "comments": [{"body": "You're going to need a backend for that. \n\nAlternatively you could just use a mailto, that way whoever is visiting your site can email you from their own email client. \n\nSomething like [this.](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_link_mailto)", "id": "e4zktr2", "replies": [{"body": "Ah okay, thanks for confirming that.

As it's for a portfolio, you've got a couple of different options.\n\n1. If you're trying to get a strictly front-end (UI/UX) job, just use a mailto: link.\n\n2. If you're applying for anything that might touch the back end, this is a great time to learn how to set it up.\n\nIf you're going with #2, let me know and I can walk you through the steps. Basically, you'll need to:\n\n1. Build a back end server with Node.js and Express.\n\n2. Have your onSubmit function push the form info to the server.\n\n3. Once the server receives it, use Nodemailer to send you an email notification.\n\nThere's a lot more info I can give you to help. Just let me know if you're going to build a back end and I'll help you out. Not worth the effort for me, though, if you're just using a mailto:\n\n\nEdit: I can also help you out a bit with AWS (or an EC2 free tier, which I use). Just let me know.", "id": "e51fb9t", "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the in-depth response! I already have a mailto: link set up and ready to go, but I wanted to give an alternative option just in case recruiters don't have access to their email at the time they came across my website.\n\nI'll likely be going for #2 jobs, so you're right that it's a great time to learn. I did a lot of research pretty much all day yesterday on what options were available. I found (although I could definitely be wrong) that the best fit for me considering the low volume would be to trigger an API call that invokes a AWS Lambda function to deliver the email. \n\nWhat do you think of this, am I on the right track??", "id": "e51fxc9", "replies": [{"body": "I'll shoot you a chat request and we can continue this there.
