Git works fine, but if I want to backup all my code, I'd need to create a repo for every project I start. I have dozens of them. Most of them are rather small, but important.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm also OK with building my own solution, i.e. buy a domain, some storage, a few python scripts etc. But I'm assuming that implementing something that does everything I listed further down the page, will take so much time as to render it not worthwhile. \n\n\u200b\n\nWhere most services I know fail:\n\nI can just throw my projects in C:\\\\Google Drive, but this means .git and cache folders, containing 100Ks files, get backed up unless I manually exclude them, every time.\n\nI also need a way to backup folders outside of GDrive root folder. Saved settings, .ini and .config files that are thrown all over.\n\n\u200b\n\nHow did you tackle these problems?\n\nI'm looking for specifically:\n\n1. Exclusion rules, like wildcard or regex. This solves the .git folders problem.\n2. Backup outside of root folder. Either \"natively\", or at least some symlink support. (Only Sync allows this)\n3. Decently priced. I don't need a 1TB storage. I'll do with a couple of 100GBs. Which means I don't think paying 10$/m is worth it. (Dropbox).\n4. Sync direction rules. For example: doesn't delete my local files when I delete their online copy (and vice versa). Or at least, throws them in trash temporarily. (GDrive does that fine)\n5. Has a search function (Sync doesn't, for example).\n\n\u200b\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nThanks,\n\nGilad\n\n\u200b", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Not an answer to you question, but a few important things to remember:\n- Version control is not backup. Git or any other vcs shouldn't be relied upon as a backup solution, especially if it has commands for manipulating old versions\n- Mirroring or replication is not backup. Anything that just synchs changes without retaining any old versions will just give you two copies of your disaster\n- If you haven't tested restoring from your backups, then you don't have backups", "id": "e4t6345", "replies": [{"body": "I get that this is true for super important enterprise projects, but do you think it's worth the effort for someone to have proper backups of their personal projects?
