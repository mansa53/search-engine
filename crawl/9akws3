Imagine it like a binary translator sort of, so multiple numbers for each letter. I just want to make one where I can type in the numbers, or a long sequence of numbers, into a text box and have it automatically translate them into letters in another box. Any help would be appreciated, and any videos that you can give me explaining this would be extremely helpful. Thanks!", "score": 1, "comments": [], "title": "Making a custom translating windows application"}
