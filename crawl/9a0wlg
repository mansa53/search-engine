Another thing you can do is check the job listings in similar positions and industries to look for common threads of highly desired skills. Finally, check LinkedIn and look at the resumes from people who have the job you want looking for specific skills and software that seems to be common to your job and the jobs vertically and laterally. Read the documents if it is proprietary, sometimes they have videos, download and play around with the software if it is publicly available. \n\nThen apply standard techniques to become a power user. Learn short cuts, learn how to turn workflows into macros, know the most common usages, know the features and benefits, read through the FAQ, read through forums looking for common problems, learn the best resources to find answers to those problems.
