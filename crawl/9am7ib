The company charges $18.00 per hour for labor. Write a program that allows the user to enter the number of rooms to be painted and the price of the paint per gallon. It should also ask for the square feet of wall space in each room. The program should have methods that return the following data:**   \n**1. The number of gallons of paint required**   \n**2. The hours of labor required**   \n**3. The cost of the paint**   \n**4. The labor charges**   \n**5. The total cost of the paint job**   \n\n\n**Then it should display it on screen.**  \n\nI have done the majority of it - [https://pastebin.com/J5jUNzgP](https://pastebin.com/J5jUNzgP)\n\nI would just like to ask a few things. \n\n**1) Is it easy to change from using** \n\n    import javax.swing.JOptionPane;\n\nto\n\n    import java.util.Scanner;\n\n**- would it require a zillion changes or is it something simple?**\n\n2) I have an additional requirement which asks me to:\n\n**Implement full validation of user input to ensure than inputs are not zero or negative; the validation routine should be written as a method.**\n\nI have done this before and it was a matter of adding a condition as I was typing up my \"if-else\" loop.\n\nT**he validation routine should be written as a method > >** How would this be done?\n\nAny ideas or advice are welcome, thanks again for your advice - Everybody on here as been super nice and helpful :) \n\n(With the exception of those tiny few :P)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks again x\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "I can help you in 4 hours if you can wait that long btw do you just want advice?", "id": "e4wjhqo", "replies": [{"body": "hey i will DM you :)", "id": "e4y4vsk", "replies": []}, {"body": "[removed]", "id": "e4ws8fz", "replies": [{"body": "Rule #5:\n\n**No Complete Solutions:** Do not give out complete solutions. **Guide** the OP to the solution, but **do not solve** it for them.", "id": "e4wxuy3", "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "1.
