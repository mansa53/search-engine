I've researched how to do this and know the easiest way is to download a library e.g. libharu.\n\nUnfortunately I have no idea what to do once I've downloaded said library.  Instructions seem to assume a greater level of competence than I have, and aren't specific to the compiler I'm using - Dev C++. \n\nFrom what I understand once I've downloaded the library I need to build it? but (and this is embarrassing) I have no idea how. \n\nThey say make or cmake if you're using visual c++ etc but not what to do for dev c++. \n\nI went out on a limb and tried using \"mingw32-make -f script\\Makefile.mingw\" to build libharu, which I thought was the right thing, but it failed:\n\n>gcc -o src/hpdf_utils.o -Iinclude -O2 -Wall -Iwin32/include -mno-cygwin  -c src/hpdf_utils.c\n>gcc: error: unrecognized command line option '-mno-cygwin'\n>script\\Makefile.mingw:142: recipe for target 'src/hpdf_utils.o' failed\n>mingw32-make: *** [src/hpdf_utils.o] Error 1\n\nCan anyone help me with this or point me in the right direction?\n\n**TLDR:** Make pdf in Dev C++ how?", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": "You aren't using Dev C++ to build it, you are using gcc (or rather, Dev C++ is the IDE, gcc is the compiler).

I just tried downloading it and getting it to work but after trying various tutorials to set it up I'm just getting to more roadblock errors I don't understand. \n\nI tried following the tutorial here: http://wiki.openttd.org/Compiling_on_Windows_using_MinGW\n\nBut I get to \n\n>If you get the error\n>\n>gcc: command not found\n>\n>browse your MinGW directory to msys\\1.0\\postinstall and run pi.bat \n\nThere's no such directory and I cant find any pi.bat anywhere.\n\nI tried https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/cpp/gcc_make.html\n\nBut it's ridiculously long and I have no idea what half of it means. \n\nIt feels like I'm going down this rabbit hole that just keeps getting deeper and deeper and I'm completely lost.", "id": "e541uci", "replies": [{"body": "> But it's ridiculously long and I have no idea what half of it means.\n\nIt's long, but the only bit you care about now is 1.4 (Installing GCC on Windows). Everything else is irrelevant. The directory is probably under either `c:/program files` or `c:/program files (x86)` or possibly directly under the C: drive, because lord knows the cygwin stuff seems to loooove installing itself there. Failing that, search for it. If it's not there, try uninstalling and installing again, paying close attention to what the installation tells you.\n\nI gave up on this crap long ago and run Linux in a VM.", "id": "e543u8z", "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for all your help so far. You don't know how much I appreciate it.\n\nI think I've managed to install it all correctly, so that takes me back to the instructions for installing libharu:\n\n>Run the configure script.\n>\n> ./configure [--prefix=/usr/local] [--with-zlib] [--with-png]\n>\n>Build the library and install. The default install paths are /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib directories.\n>\n >make install\n\nHow do I run the configure script?
