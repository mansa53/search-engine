Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, code receives run-time instructions as to which in a family of algorithms to use.Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it. Strategy is one of the patterns included in the influential book Design Patterns by Gamma et al. that popularized the concept of using design patterns to describe how to design flexible and reusable object-oriented software.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28", "id": "e4t0ogx", "replies": []}, {"body": "Is this also suitable if the respective tile-functions are always the same for a specific tile and only differ between unequal tile-types?", "id": "e4t11g0", "replies": [{"body": "Yes, it is.", "id": "e4t197h", "replies": [{"body": "Thanks!", "id": "e4t78zx", "replies": []}]}]}]}], "title": "Is there a pattern/design choice for my problem?"}
