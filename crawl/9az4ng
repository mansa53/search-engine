It's a nice first attempt, but there are some more obvious problems that you need to work out.\n\nOthers have mentioned ways to fix your header list issue. They've also mentioned removing padding from the `html` and `body` elements so you don't have the white padding around your site.\n\nBut something I haven't seen mentioned is your transparent header. I think that's an unfortunate UI design; it looks OK when the header image is showing through, but not when it's covering text. Perhaps use Javascript to set opacity to full once you've scrolled past the header image, or animate the opacity away from full when you scroll all the way to the top. Either way, the transparent header with text behind it makes it hard to read.\n\nYou use a lot of `border-style: dotted` borders, but it's not a good look. \n\nYour Contact page is also broken, the developers/email doesn't line up with the headers. \n\nI recommend checking out a UI Framework like Bulma, Bootstrap, Semantic, Foundation, or any of the others. I'm not saying you should use these frameworks or toolkits, but you can take a look at the design elements they're using, then take inspiration from them.\n\nFor example, a lot of your dotted-line bordered divs are really \"alerts\". Check out how Bulma designs their notifications:\n\nhttps://bulma.io/documentation/elements/notification/\n\nOr bootstrap:\n\nhttps://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/alerts/", "id": "e4z51qd", "replies": [{"body": "Yea I wasn\u2019t sure why the contact page gets off-centered.. when you view in safari everything is normal but chrome starts to give me problems and I\u2019m not sure what I did wrong", "id": "e4z5gb7", "replies": [{"body": "Well, one of your biggest problems is manually spacing things with `<br>` tags. That's really really bad practice, and I recommend you spend some time learning CSS layouts properly. Look up all the different `display` values, and pay special attention to `display: flex`.\n\nYou have a similar bad practice of using tables for layout. Once you understand how to lay things out with CSS better, you can avoid tables. That said, you're mangling the table layout too with CSS.\n\nThis alone should make your code more cross-browser compatible. But always test in multiple browsers. Safari is rapidly becoming the next Internet Explorer when it comes to being standards-compliant, so test in Chrome and Firefox (also the two most used browsers, so you're testing with what your users will most likely use).\n\nBasically, I'm suggesting that you take a course in this before continuing, because you've come a long way on your own, but it's obvious that you're teaching yourself.
