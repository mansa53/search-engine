What other languages would I need, if any? And is swift useful for anything else besides iOS? Another thing I want to know is related to HTML- I know you need HTML for webpages to markup and see the text, is there something similar for apps? Or  are languages for making apps (Swift) sort of like an all-in-one? Or is the process completely different, with there being no need for a markup lang?\n\nAlso, I know with making webpages I can just create them in any text editor and open them using a browser, and I don\u2019t have to host them or anything to see how they look.. so what about apps for iOS? Is there somewhere I could create it and then continuously open it and check on it like I can with HTML?", "score": 13, "comments": [{"body": "> should I learn swift + something else? Or just swift?\n\nSwift is all you need assuming it's a basic app.\n\n> What other languages would I need, if any?\n\nNone, maybe a little xml for config stuff, but that's mostly just filling in forms.\n\n> And is swift useful for anything else besides iOS?\n\nAlso macOS, tvOS, and watchOS, but right now it's mostly limited to the apple world.  There is an open source compiler but I don't think it is used much outside of the apple ecosystem. \n\n> I know you need HTML for webpages to markup and see the text, is there something similar for apps?\n\nI don't think there a markup language for ios apps, but there's a ui builder that's mostly point and click, think like the web's WYSIWYG editors.\n\n> so what about apps for iOS? Is there somewhere I could create it and then continuously open it and check on it like I can with HTML?\n\nYou'll need a mac running xcode, but yes, it includes an iOS emulator so you just re-run your app and it'll load in the emulator.\n\nGood luck!", "id": "e51souk", "replies": [{"body": "> You'll need a mac running xcode  \n  \nIs it also possible on Linux/Windows?\n\n", "id": "e52a75f", "replies": [{"body": "I don't think so, at least not easily.

The changes that you make in XML would show in the in-editor display so you can have an idea on what it will end up looking like.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs far as I know, Swift is pretty much only used in iOS - don't quote me on that though.

You\u2019ll need a Mac with Xcode on it.\n\nI\u2019ve seen a framework for Swift bases backends, but it hasn\u2019t really caught on yet as far as I know.
