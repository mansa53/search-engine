My workplace is now solely involved in refurbishing phones/tablets/laptops. Its become tedious and boring and stressful. I'm 47 years old. I live in the UK and I'm waiting this job out whilst we see what impact Brexit has. I learnt some programming in school/college but that was 25+ years ago so it's as good as useless now as I will have forgotten\n\nI'm wondering what I can realistically learn in 6-9 months that could possibly help me change job. I've thought maybe Web Dev, however I keep seeing Big Data and Hadoop. I also like Linux but have very basic knowledge of using it. I have no idea what I could realistically achieve in 6-9 months to make me employable in a new IT role.\n\nI thought this sub may have people with expertise in these areas rather than asking in a career sub. \n\nReally I'm asking what's achievable in this timeframe considering my lack of experience, age and lack of Math skills. I don't want to start something and find I'm in too deep. Can anyone recommend anything based in the above.\n\nThanks.", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Any dev role will challenge you to keep up with rapid changing tools and languages. Not to scare you but it is a continuous race to keep up with coding trends and fads, even ones that suck because employer wants to use them. \n\nMaybe can work in a data center that hosts servers. Learning Linux admin is prob a better growth path as that arena is only sure to explode and fairly consistent across devices and an easier crossover than trying to sell yourself as a web dev against hordes of youngsters born coding in diapers.
