So I made a twitter account to post updates since it would seem more suitable than always posting about it on the r/learnprogramming subreddit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFollow if you're interested!", "score": 0, "comments": [], "title": "Twitter account for people who want to stay updated on the programming youtube videos from scratch"}
