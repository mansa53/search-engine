Very new to programming (sorry for any ignorance).\n\nI'm using scrapy to pull item data from https://www.lacoste.com/us/lacoste/sale/men-s-sale/\n\nI would just like to pull the item data (and if possible the picture as well) into a spreadsheet. I'm not sure how to use a selector to parse the data. The items are categorized into a grid and each item is associated with a \"<li class=\"cell-7 cell-m-11 row-vspaced\">...>/li>\" \n\n\nRight now I only have the class and url setup.\nI have a feeling this is a very simple process but I'm not sure how to go about it. \nAny advice on this would be very much appreciated.

Spaces in CSS are represented by dots, and the ::text gets the text value, so your query is\n\n    response.css(\".product-box-link.js-product-track::text\").extract()\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUse the same principle for the price. Since you want to differentiate between regular and discounted prices, and I assume you want the discounted price, you find that it is in the class \"price\", style=color: #ef2f2f. Note that since the regular price is also of class \"price\", you'll extract both if you run\n\n    response.css(\".price::text\").extract()\n\nTherefore you need to specify that the value you want belongs to the class that is not \"price price--old\", like so:\n\n    response.css(\".price:not(.price--old)::text\").extract()\n\nIf you have any other questions feel free to ask, I'm a scrapy beginner as well\n\n||||\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||||\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "e5ahu90", "replies": [{"body": "Wow this is exactly what I was looking for!
