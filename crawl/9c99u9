The issue you're facing is that you're trying to use a remote, text-only, connection to another computer (PuTTY).

Holding down Alt+Left to skip by word should help a lot, for example.\n\nHowever, it sounds like what might make you a lot happier is to maybe connect to your MySQL database in some other way other than using PuTTY. There are dozens and dozens of GUIs that you can use to work with your MySQL database, and virtually all of them will let you use your mouse to edit.
