But it doesn't appear (as far as i gather) that you can get it from a single user, looks to be based around what place has been reviewed instead.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions or know one/more APIs which might be useful?", "score": 2, "comments": [], "title": "How to get all reviews that a single user made in Google Places or similar API?"}
