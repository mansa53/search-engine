It has a daemon, several executables, etc. What I want is just to send requests to it. Eg, I send a post request, and one of the .exe's runs, and then some value is returned. I can run that .exe in my command line, but don't know how to get it to be like a server. I have it hosted on an AWS instance, if that helps (I know that I would need to have it hosted in order to make it permanent). I also have built servers in Node, so I know what it would be like with JavaScript. \n\nI'm hoping/guessing that there's something analogous for C++, but really have no idea..\n\nThanks in advance!!", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Are you talking about a HTTP server, or using a custom protocol?\n\nEither way, Boost ASIO (And Beast for HTTP) is a good starting point.", "id": "e5c67oj", "replies": []}, {"body": "The easiest and most common option is to use CGI. Basically you run some other standard web server like Apache - you can probably already find it installed on your AWS instance, or install it easily. You put your compiled C++ program in the cgi-bin directory or configure the server to execute your script.\n\nThen, when someone visits the url for your program, Apache executes your program and sets environment variables with the URI, some information about who requested it (the remote host), and stuff like that. Then your program just prints whatever it wants to stdout and Apache sends it back to the client.\n\nThere are CGI libraries for C++. If you want to accept HTML form data, I'd recommend using a library. If you just want to parse the URL then you could just do it yourself.\n\nLook up CGI and getenv and you should be good to go.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "e5c5ucp", "replies": []}], "title": "Creating a C++ Server"}
