Next semester, I will be taking Discrete Math Or calc, along with Programming Fundamentals and Intro to networks. \n\nI want to take 4 courses that count for my major next semester since I'm already behind. Now here's the thing, right now I'm in intro to CS. \n\nIntro to Networks and Programming Principles pre req is Intro to CS. However this only leads me with 3 courses and I want to take one more. The one course I want to take is Computer Organization. \n\nI am motivated to learn and am jobless this semester. However it reccommends that you take programming principles before computer organization. It says I can take it concurrently though. \n\nMy questions are. \n\nWhat should I attempt to learn on the side given my situation? I'm in Pre Calc right now so I can do better in calc. \n\nNext semester I am for sure taking Discrete or Calc, Programming Principles, Intro to networks. \n\nShould I take Computer Organization and Programming Principles concurrently even though PP is a pre-req? I really need to graduate and no job means I have more time to study. \n\nComputer Organization Definition at my UNI-This study of computer organization covers the central processor unit, memory unit and I/0 unit, number systems, character codes and I/O programming. Programming assignments provide practice working with assembly language techniques, including looping, addressing modes, arrays, subroutines, and macros. Microsoft assembler is discussed and used for programming throughout the course. \n\nThis is all jumbled and kind of all over the place. I just hope someone is able to understand what I'm trying to articulate. \n\n\nShould I be fine taking Discrete, Programming Principles, Intro to Networks, Computer organization next semester or is it next to impossible?

Discrete Math/Calc I'll already have the Pre-Reqs. I would also have the Pre req for Programming Fundamentals and Intro to Networks. What I want to know if it will be feasible for me to do \"Computer Organization\" at the same time given the description. \n\nI am in a hurry for both reasons.

If it were me, I would space out the classes as much as possible. But, that's me and you might do better in an environment that is more intensive. \n\nSince a CS major is heavy in math too, the workload can be pretty big, especially if you're paying closer attention in your CS classes.\n\nBe honest with yourself and whether or not you can take the workload. If so? great! If not, space out your classes more.
