The most advanced thing I ever learned in math was pretty basic algebra. I've been going through the chapters on learncpp.com and I'm on chapter 4 - it's been going well but I can't help but think that I could really do with some more math skills when working with C++ for more advanced problems.\n\nHowever, I don't have any access to formal education currently (only online resources for the most part), and it's hard to find a good resource for math. If anyone has any good resources that you think are particularly relevant/useful for programming then I'd love to hear suggestions, or just any other insight about what areas of math are good to study etc. is welcome.
