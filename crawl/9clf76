Use it for everything in my daily job, but I caught my self thinking if it really worth using one programming language in everywhere.\n\nI use React for Web Dev, React Native for Mobile and Node for building the Back-End. So I know that i can use JS for everything, but the real question is: Should I use JS for everything?\n\nMaybe I should learn Java for Android Native Development and Desktop, Golang for Back-End and Python some other stuff. Even if i can do all of this with a JS Framework.  \n\n\nShould I keep with JS and learn more about it's frameworks? Or should i trying to learn a new stuff for each Development area?", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Thing is, in webdev you CAN do everything in JS.

After all Javascript is definitely not the fastest language out there and there are whole fields at which it frankly sucks (anything related to hardware R&D, high performance applications, machine learning and so on). For instance a startup project I am part of uses a custom build server written in Rust. It was one of the few options that could actually get us sufficient performance (very computational heavy tasks) without sacrificing safety. It was an interesting journey from your typical web development when you suddenly start caring about \"how to avoid copying data\", apply a custom version of MapReduce algorithm and build a scalable multithreaded application from scratch. It also taught me a lot. \n\nI dislike the idea of learning languages for the sake of learning languages however. Do it when you feel it will give you tangible benefits. Be it when it comes to performance, compatibility or it simply having more options available. For instance Python has by far the most mature environment when it comes to more scientific parts of programming with tons of libraries for statistics, machine learning, machine vision. \nLearning a lower level language is useful if you really want performance. For instance here's a comparison of it vs NodeJS in a real life application:\n\nhttps://blog.figma.com/rust-in-production-at-figma-e10a0ec31929\n\nAnd so on. Find a field you want to improve at and see if learning a different language makes sense along the way.

I'm trying to improve my developer skills because I have plans to start doing some freelancing jobs and stuff like that. Now a days Web and Mobile are the fields with more Freelancing Jobs, so I should learn some Java or other programming language for back-end.
