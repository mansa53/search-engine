Also do you happen to know how far the C++ course will go?  \n\n___\n\nIf it's anything like my C++ course that I took last term, then a good understanding of the stuff I just mentioned, which we covered a term before, was needed, or you were basically screwed from the start.  Once again, I don't know how much you have covered and what you are expected to know.\n\nIn general, knowing C will make the basic C++ syntax portion really easy, as they're near identical.  If you happen to have a good grasp of memory, pointers, and heap, then that will make concepts like references a breeze as well, and you'll be able to use the tools C++ gives you well.\n\nIf you're good at Java and learned OOP, then the concepts of OOP will translate really well into C++.  \n\n\n", "id": "e54zmy1", "replies": []}, {"body": "Yes, the curve will be steep. I would concentrate on learning one of C or Java _really_ well (seeing as you have some knowledge of them already), to the level where you can write useful applications, rather than trying to learn three languages badly.", "id": "e54azgh", "replies": [{"body": "Thing is, professors at my college want us to work with C++ in class assignments and labs.

The primary benefit of c++ over c is the use of classes and data structures.

That is not the big difference between the three languages.  The basic difference (although there are many others) is that  C and C++ are  value based, and that Java is reference based. This makes the semantics of Java completely different from those of C or C++, though of course they all share some trivial syntax for things like loops.", "id": "e54en6c", "replies": [{"body": "Reference *based*?  I wouldn't say that.
