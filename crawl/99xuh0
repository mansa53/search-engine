This is for no other reason than my personal learning.\n\nWhen trying to optimize an algorithm for finding the last number in a large Fib number, and doing some research into its solution, I came across Pisano Period, and it occurred to me that I am missing some context, particularly in number theory and mathematical notation. \n\nWhat would you suggest I read to learn about properties of numbers/number theory? For example:\n\n- Pisano Period (already cited)\n- Understanding the Sieve of Eratosthenes\n- Modulo math\n- Explanations of mathematical notation (what it means when I see a sigma, the super/subscript values, arrows, etc) that I might see when proofs of algorithms are expanded\n\nBasically I am looking for a book/books that can provide some additional context behind the solutions I am using (for example, why the Pisano Period would be useful for creating a fast algorithm), and the symbols used in the explanations.\n\nThank you.\n", "score": 6, "comments": [{"body": "You should also ask on r/learnmath", "id": "e4rhm2b", "replies": [{"body": "Good idea, thank you", "id": "e4rhz02", "replies": []}]}], "title": "Sources of Learning For Number Theory/Mathematical Notation?"}
