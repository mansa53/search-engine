I graduated from college with a degree in Finance and would like to make the jump into product management in about a year. I have experience managing teams and projects, so I'm less worried about the soft skills as I am about the hard skills. I have about 12-15 hours a week that I can dedicate to learning or working on other projects, but I feel directionless right now. Here are some things I'm thinking about...\n\n\\- I plan on learning SQL and Python. Will that be enough for product management? Will an employer want some sort of certification of my proficiency, since I have a non-technical degree? \n\n\\-Being on the Investor Relations team gives me a lot of access to our actual product managers, but I'm afraid to ask them too much about their jobs since I feel I know so little. What should I know before going into those meetings, and what kinds of questions will make for a productive discussion?\n\nAny and all advice welcome !!", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/\n\nAnd are you asking about financial products or software products?", "id": "e56j76o", "replies": []}, {"body": "Product managers that I've worked with in the past were not really programmers. That said, my career has entirely been with internal business software, never commercial, so that experience may be different.\n\nSQL and Python would probably be useful skills for analytical purposes, if you want to be able to process data and run analysis and statistical models and things like that. But I don't know if it would strictly be required.\n\nRemember though, most of us here are actually programmers or people learning to be. You might not get the best perspective on the tangentially-related careers like this. /r/cscareerquestions may be better, but there might be a product manager-specific subreddit out there too for all I know.\n\nI'd ask those project managers you have access to questions. It's not as big of a deal as you think to appear new at what you're doing. In my experience, most people will want to talk about what they do if you show some interest, especially if it's not normally considered a particularly interesting profession. I know that most people are bored if I talk about work, so the people that are actually interested I'll gladly talk to about it, and not judge them for not knowing.", "id": "e56jt0k", "replies": []}], "title": "One year from now, I want to move into product management.
