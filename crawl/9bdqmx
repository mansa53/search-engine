I really don't know. I log on a website to learn \"programming\" or \"coding\" and they are already asking me if I want to study computer science, web development, data analysis.... why the hell are you asking me that when I don't even know the difference between them!!! Backend, front end, software engineering.... The list goes on. Everyone's advice is contradicting, the path is so unclear, the options are endless... can't someone who has actually reached the end (or close to the end) map it out for us... Help us visualize the path... give us a framework..\nI need a map. A curriculum... A-Z... does it exist. There's too much information and I'm drowning. Please......Help.....\n\nP.S : don't give me the first step. cause then when I finish it I will just be in the same position I am now... give me a map. A general guideline I can follow. A curriculum. THE WHOLE PICTURE. Please. Before I die... I hope you guys can empathize with me\n\n#codingforlife\n\n#wegonnagetthroughthis\n\n#WTHisgoingon\n\n#pleasehelp\n\n\n", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "No, you can't actually reach an end. There are so many people that are good on levels beyond imagination, like xoreaxeaxeax, or Linus Torvalds, Knuth and so many others walking on the edge of the map, into uncharted territories.\n\nHowever, they are not Jacks of all trades, they are specialized.\n\nImagine a huge circle. That's the computer/information circle. Every career title is a speck on this circle. You can take any path and end up 180 degrees the other way, on the edge of this circle. \n\n2 years ago, I began hating Math, now, I am studying Statistical Learning. A literal 180 degree turn. All it takes, is willingness.\n\nSoo, what do you like to do? How do you enjoy spending your time?\n\nDo you like math? There is MachineLearning, Theoretical Computer Science and other careers.\n\nDo you have an artistic vein? Let it all pour out in video games and webdesign.\n\nThe only way to know what you truly want to do is pick a path and see whether you like it or not.
