They will contain images, text fields,  drop-down lists, check boxes and tables. After receiving them back I will run a script that reads the input data and upload it to an SQL Server database. The form must be offline, as the customers might not always have a permanent web connection (it's pretty common in this business).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI tried reading PDFs with Java and C# libraries but many times the input data is ignored and I'm getting an error specifying that OpenType fonts will be omitted. \n\nAnother viable option will be using Excel for the forms, the downside of this being that the forms won't look as well and professional.\n\nAre there any other options I should consider? Maybe other file format for the forms or maybe there are other programming languages with better support for reading PDFs.", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": "Adobe Acrobat (PDF) forms allow exporting the form only data as XML.
