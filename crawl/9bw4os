I'm trying to edit [some code I grabbed from LunaMetrics for use in Google Tag Manager (GTM)](https://www.lunametrics.com/labs/recipes/vimeo-tracking-for-gtm/)\u2014basically, creating a listener for a web player (iframe embed) that isn't a popular platform. As I'm looking at the code, I see some syntax I'm not familiar with.\n\n\u200b\n\nI have essentially taught myself Javascript w/ different sites and [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/). I'm definitely missing some knowledge, but the things I'm looking for are hard to search because English.\n\n\u200b\n\nI don't understand what the following line of code (ES2015 I believe) is supposed to execute:\n\n`function init() {`\n\n`var videos = filter_(selectAllTags_('iframe'), isVimeo);`\n\n`if (!videos.length) return;`\n\n`loadApi(function () {`\n\n`forEach_(videos, listenTo);`\n\n`});`\n\n`}`\n\nWhat does the exclamation point mean? Also, since `return` immediately follows that, does that break the function off at that point and return undefined? Is `loadApi` a function inside of `init()`? Are they closures?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, is there a way I can test GTM code w/o going through GTM's web interface\u2014maybe just through Chrome's console (i.e. try out my mods with a couple of videos, not live on the whole site)?", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "! is boolean negation, so `!false = true`, here this means that videos.length, which is an integer, is converted into a boolean where 0 becomes false anything else becomes true, then that is inverted.\n\nEssentially `if (!videos.length) return` returns if videos.length is 0 or undefined.", "id": "e565vcg", "replies": [{"body": "Ohhh.
