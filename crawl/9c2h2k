So i thought to myself build something everyone is familiar with,. Because i \"assumed\" they would want to update stuff by themselves\n\n\nOn top of that somewhere lying between wanting complete control and wanting to push my boundaries i decided to create a fully custom theme for the website...  Was pretty interesting trip (not completely done). Long story short it has been over a month and I am.questioning my decision to  have used WP.\n\n\nIt isn't that it isn't good, i honestly thought the term \"WordPress develope\" was an oxymoron until i actually delved deep and realized you can really customize a bunch of things to your own fancy.\n\nBut everywhere I see, wp isn't exactly getting much love, and i found out they just want me to continuously update the site, no one else would be doing it.... \n\nIt is a portfolio-ish website with some news updates here and there, should I drop it and go with something else, such as maybe octobercms or should I get out of my own head and finish the job with whatever I started and WP is fine and I shouldn't piss my pants about it?\n\n\nI know the tools don't maketh the man but they sure as hell make him nervous", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": "I would say just stick it out, unless you honestly thing it will be less work to redo it now", "id": "e57hgv4", "replies": []}, {"body": "What do you want to do with your career? What interests you?\n\nIf I had to guess, WordPress isn't looked well upon in the developer world because it's too restrictive. Why would you put training wheels to a professional BMX rider? He doesn't need it and it will only slow him down.\n\nWordPress is a good tool for non-CS people, but if a CS person wanted to be a proper front-end developer they could **potentially** hamstring their skillset by only focusing on WordPress.", "id": "e57l531", "replies": [{"body": "Aaaay,  since I have some freedom this being the task handed to me, no restrictions were posed upon me, i completely proceeded based on assumptions (you know what they say about assumptions)  do you advice me to drop the WordPress theme development,  or perhaps in my own time develop the identical site with other tools since this one is online now, (needs minor minor fixes i think ) and once I am done with the alternate one, just switch it, instead of taking down the site , or looking like a useless ass who is redoing something that is already 80% done.", "id": "e57v6uh", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Definitely just finish unless they have some requirement that you believe might be impossible in Wordpress. Image yourself in a future job interview discussing the project:\n\n\"Hmm, you used Wordpress. That's a bit older, why not something more cutting edge?\"\n\n\"After looking into various solutions I realized that Wordpress would fulfill all the project requirements and it would allow me to do so faster than other options.\"\n\nBoom, totally shut that question down. That's what companies value most, employees who can take requirements and make something that fulfills them in a timely manner. You'll look way better than the other guy they're interviewing who re-implemented a perfectly good algorithm in Go because it's trendy.", "id": "e57vcoa", "replies": [{"body": "And to be honest, I do not feel it was a complete waste,  i mean, with my basic PHP knowledge i did something from scratch, or should i say scratch-ish, you make a sound argument, ", "id": "e57xp6p", "replies": []}]}], "title": "Somewhere between advice and validation?"}
