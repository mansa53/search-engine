I managed to also learn node and i built my first larger project. It basically is a website to which users can register. Registered users can upload quotes, as well as comment like and change some settings. I am completely self-taught and I think that it would be great to receive some feedback on my code, so i can learn from my mistakes. The app in total has about 2.5 - 3k lines of code, however more than half of that is html and css which i don't really mind about that much. The files that are the most important for me are routes/profile-routes.js and routes/quote-routes.js. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLink to GitHub repository: [https://github.com/niktnikt/Quote](https://github.com/niktnikt/Quote)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: If you decide to help me a bit, please take in mind that this website isn't very secure (I didn't pay that much attention to that - I just wanted to have something that works). When i started to build this app i didn't know about Promise.all() so i basically kept on chaining all the operations in my routes even when they didn't require that. This app doesn't work if there are less than one user and 5 quotes in the DB (I already added that). If you have any questions feel free to ask!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you so much!", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Learn how to use async/await!
