There will be two components: whiteboarding + pair programming. I'm good with the whiteboarding (more or less) but I'm not quite ready for the pair programming.\n\nThe recruiter wasn't specific with what exactly the pair programming will entail but my guess is that I'll be Tic tac toe type of stuff or perhaps DOM manipulation.\n\nAre there any recommended resources that I can use to help prepare myself for the interview? Like tutorials for building simple projects catered towards exploring JS fundamentals.", "score": 6, "comments": [{"body": "Have you done Wes Bos's [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/) course yet?
