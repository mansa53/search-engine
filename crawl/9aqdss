It is interesting in the fact that it is kind of easy to follow in the beginning and makes lots of sense but once you try programming on your own it gets quite difficult? Is that normal or some people are just not meant to be programmers?", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "Programming is hard like other creative activities. Any time you step away from the tutorials and start building something yourself, you're relying on your own skill instead of someone else's. And at the beginning, you don't have any skill. So you experience the difficulty; that's refining and honing your skill and eventually it'll be easier and you'll be able to do more things.\n\nPeople don't sit down one day and say \"I think I'll become an artist\" and then paint their masterpiece. Most of them start the same way and are probably at one point asked \"why is painting so hard\".", "id": "e4x9jsu", "replies": []}, {"body": "> It is interesting in the fact that it is kind of easy to follow in the beginning and makes lots of sense but once you try programming on your own it gets quite difficult?\n\nWhat about painting?  It's easy to use a coloring book or paint-by-numbers kit.  Does that mean it should be easy to draw a portrait freehand?\n\nA better question than \"Why is programming so hard\" is \"Why do you expect programming to be easy?\"", "id": "e4xaonr", "replies": []}, {"body": "Yes. Programming is a learned skill, like blacksmithing, painting, glassblowing, or speaking French. Can I attend a glassblowing class and learn to make a little pumpkin thing with a mold in an hour or two? Yes, totally, and it'll be a lot of fun. You should do it. But making original stuff on your own? That takes time.", "id": "e4xb3eq", "replies": []}, {"body": "If it were always easy, anybody could do it and it wouldn't pay well.\n\nBut to answer your questions: Most of it gets easier as you learn more and get experience, but some people do not have the aptitude or mental firepower to be programmers.\n\nIt's hard when you start off though. There's just too much you don't know.", "id": "e4xm1nq", "replies": []}, {"body": "Yes, this is really typical.  And I'd argue it isn't really that hard.  Certainly something like reading or writing is much, much harder, but you were taught that slowly over many, many years.  You're probably trying to do too much at once.
