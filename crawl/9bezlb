The best analogy I can give you is: you might know grammar very well, but that doesn't mean you can write a convincing essay. So, you really only need to know enough about the language to build an application with it. Low-level programming *does* require some more knowledge of the language for the sake of efficiency, but even then, it really boils down to: can you build something with it.   \n\n\nAlso, it's very difficult to put a quantity on something like the knowledge of a language. What kind of response would you expect? What units? 10 hours of studying? 10 libraries written? 8 books read? It's pretty much impossible to quantify that knowledge. Which is why people put much more weight on \"what have you built\" and \"how would you build X?\" questions.", "id": "e52l50m", "replies": [{"body": "When I said low level programming jobs, I meant like the most basic of basic of programming jobs and not the low level languages", "id": "e52n6qc", "replies": [{"body": "Ah well the answer is pretty much still the same. If you can build a useful tool in a language, you're ready to be hired.
