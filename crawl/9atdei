A member will enter their user# followed by their password. Once they loginin it will keep track how long they've been playing. Basically keeping a running total of how many hours they been playing ever since they became a member. \n\nI would like to make this a simple desktop application running on windows that a admin could edited member information when needed.Not sure how to proceed or where to begin. I feel like this would require SQL which I have a novice understanding of. Any direction would be greatly appreciated ", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "I feel like this is a perfect candidate for a web app. Making a desktop application really restricts the usability and versatility of such a program.\n\nBut as far as technology, SQL will definitely be useful here.
