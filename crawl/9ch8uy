I want to improve my skills by attending to classes on the weekend. My work hours are 9-6 Monday to Friday, and I usually get home by 7 and go to the gym sometimes. The classes are from 9-6 as well on Saturday and Sunday. They last about 3-4 months. Basically I would have a very little spare time for anything else. My gf has been supportive, but I'm not too sure if I can handle it, but at the same time, I really want to improve my skillset. Should I \"just do it!\"? Anyone else done this?", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Are online classes not an option?
