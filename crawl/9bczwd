I come to you as a someone forced into learning about web development as the young person in  the office.  \n\nPart of my job is maintaining of an online schedule on SuperSaas, along with report forms that are generated with that tool.  We spend a lot of time forwarding every report to a separate email address (to the specific teachers of the students who visit us).  2,000-3,000 every academic year.  (Before I arrived, they were using paper forms!)   \n\n..I am interested in learning what routes I can take to read an email address inside a form created in SuperSaas.   SuperSaas allows us to email all forms to one address, so we also have a dedicated Gmail inbox that stores each report form as an HTML attachment.  The email address would be listed in a field on that form. \n\nIt seems like there are two fairly simple tasks here that a novice like me should be able to learn about.\n\n1. Parse the email address and other form info from the attachments and place in a Google Sheet\n2. Then send info to email address listed in the Google Sheet\n\nOr, another path would be something integrated with Gmail that forwards the message itself.  But I've encountered commercial/prepackaged tools that perform the above 2 steps.  I just haven't been able to  string together a solution thus far and can  use some help.  \n\nI  would love to know where to look or what I'm shopping for, so to speak.  I had some trouble with Zapier because it couldn't work with the correct form (it can link to steps \"1\" and \"3\" as the form gets updated,  but I need step \"2\" of the form -- most never evolve past that first update from  the worker).  Has anyone tried Mailparser for tasks like this?  Or another tool out there?  We already pay for SuperSaas so cheap would be better but we do have a budget if it works well (it's a school office).  \n\nCould anyone be so kind as to  point me in the direction of a possible method, tools that exist, or skills I will need  to learn.  I am confident I can  sent something up in a few weeks if I know what I'm building or the direction to head.  Or if there's better sub to explore, I would love that too!
