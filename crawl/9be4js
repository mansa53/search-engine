Does anyone have some advice?", "score": 8, "comments": [{"body": "I think it would be beneficial to first identify the areas where you think you aren't up to speed and start from there. Is it vocabulary? Concepts? Language constructs? How to break problems down? How to even approach a complex problem?\n\nThe idea is to build yourself a little roadmap of the important things to learn, first at a high-level, and then digging more into details when you get there. It helps to spend some time reading material related to those areas and, of course, practice, practice, practice! Invest some of your personal time into this. Things will eventually start to click and you'll be more confident in your abilities.\n\nHope that helps.", "id": "e52fv6m", "replies": [{"body": "Thanks, that was very helpful.

Everyone has different learning styles for a start, and different personal requirements for understanding what they are doing, rather than copying someone else\u2019s example. A lot do the latter while waiting for the understanding to click - which is fine, because it will but it might take a while - but it can make it seem like they \u2018know\u2019 more. Don\u2019t fret! This is normal and exactly what an internship is all about. \n\nIf you speak to your supervisor and express your concerns, they should be able to offer you feedback which will either reassure you,  or tell you if there actually is a problem - and help you sort it out.
