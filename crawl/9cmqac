When I had to create a calculator, I'd create calculator.py, if I wanted to create a Helloworld program I'd create helloworld.py. I'm learning java (eclipse) and I'm not sure what the equivalent is in Eclipse & Java. Should I create packages or projects from the menu?\n\nSide question: When you're dealing with Java that has many classes, where exactly do you put the \"main method\"? Does every class have one? Or is there one special class that is supposed to have one?", "score": 17, "comments": [{"body": "Alright, \n1) It's the same as in python. If you want to create a calculator you make calculator.java and so on\n\n2) Regarding packages in java, consider it as a folder that contains one or more classes (or any files). You can choose any way you want to organise your packages. You can have nested packages (i.e. packages inside packages).\n\n3) About the main method, it is always executed first, therefore, it doesn't matter in which class you put it. However it's a good practice to make a separate class for the main method, we usually call it a \"driver class\"\nFor instance, if I have an Employee class, my main method would be in EmployeeDriver class.\n\nHope this helps!", "id": "e5brxbn", "replies": []}, {"body": "Packages are a way for you to manage your program. They live inside your programs project folder. Say your building a employee management system. You have a package where you put your database access methods, a package to clean up employee names, a package to calculate hours worked, etc. \n\nIn each of these packages you work on classes and methods that are relevant to that packet in much the same Way you have modules in Python. When you do import os, or import numpy in Python this is like importing a package in Java. You get much cleaner code. \n\nThere is only one main class with a public static void main in there,it is the entry point of your program. Every other class should be in a project folder or in a package and well organized.\n\nHere are some examples for structures. \n\nhttps://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/.\n\nhttp://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html#\n\nHope it helps.
