I know in java \"this\" keyword refers to the current instance of a class. \n\nNow in android sometimes we do `Intent intent=new Intent(this,SecondActivity.class);` for reference: [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent#Intent(java.lang.String,%20android.net.Uri,%20android.content.Context,%20java.lang.Class%3C?%3E)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent#Intent(java.lang.String,%20android.net.Uri,%20android.content.Context,%20java.lang.Class%3C?%3E))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere in this case is `this` referring to the current object or it referring to the object of the parent class?\n\n `public Intent (`[`Context`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html) `packageContext,`  [`Class`](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/Class.html)`<?> cls)  //Context is the parent class of the Activity class`\n\n&#x200B;", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "`this` is _always_ the current object.
