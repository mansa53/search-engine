This is more about my future as a developer, so I decided to post here. Please let me know if there's a better place for this post.\n\nI have a goal to be able to make a living as a developer within 3 years. I'd rather not talk about why 3 years specifically, but to start off I want to have a solid plan ASAP. I'm just not sure what I should be learning. I can't start a CS degree because of the deadline.\n\nI've been developing for ~9 months already, working with various languages and frameworks to explore the technology, for fun. I have not made any steps towards becoming employable until now, but I like to think I have a solid understanding of basic programming concepts. Python is my favorite language, and I have also been learning HTML/CSS/JS at my course, so the obvious answer is to learn some form of web development like backend with Django/Flask and get employed. But if possible, I'd like to work for myself and write apps for people (not limited to web apps, I'd love to code mobile apps and games).\n\nShould I go and practice web dev for employment anyway, or is 3 years enough time to become self-employed? Are there any other options relevant to my situation?\n\nP.S: Sorry if I don't respond straight away, this is a late night thought and I really should be asleep.", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "I think developing and publishing your own apps would be the best thing to do I think.

They are all self-taught or taught through training programs and no college degrees.  My biggest issue is I can't really experiment on my own and I'm using [VB.Net](https://VB.Net), which nobody uses really anymore.  Doing projects on your own is very much recommended but I've seen people talk about how they started out doing contract work and that helps.
