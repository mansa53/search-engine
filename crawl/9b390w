The form data is always the same for the same page regardless of URL, so thats nice, but im not sure of the best way to format this so it works.\n\nI don't need the browser window to actually open, I just want to insert the survey ID, and receive the validation code at the end.\n\nI have form data on hand, and some sample request urls but i want to make sure it send the right form data to the right url, without knowing the URL ahead of time.\n\n\u200b\n\nmy thoughts are to do a search on each page for text in specific questions, and assign that to a boolean for each individual page. then send the form data for the whole page if the boolean for that question  =  true.\n\n\u200b\n\nthe validation code can be pulled from class, or by search for the text \"validation code: \" and grabbing the appropriate amount of chars after that.\n\n\u200b\n\nany thoughts or ideas would be greatly appreciated, and more info is available, but i don't know what else to add without being too concise.\n\n\u200b\\*edited for spelling", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "I hope you're not trying to do something illegal, or something that violates a website's terms of service. There are many legitimate uses for automation, but we want no part of doing something shady.\n\nMy first inclination would be to try to do it using only Selenium, or only using http (requests plus maybe also BeautifulSoup), but not both.\n\nWith Selenium, you could just script the whole page - have it open the survey, click checkboxes, then click submit when you're done, and then search the page for the resulting validation code and save it.\n\nAlternatively, you could use requests or beautifulsoup to fetch the page, look for the checkboxes, and submit a form based on what you see. That's also reasonable.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "e505vjz", "replies": [{"body": "Certainly not looking to do something illegal, or break TOS's for anyone.\n\nThe problem with using selenium is that if you automate a click, and the survey serves up a new page you don't have scripted, your whole script goes out the window, unless im missing some function in selenium.", "id": "e509zrm", "replies": [{"body": "That's definitely solvable with Selenium.
