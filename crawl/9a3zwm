There\u2019s no mention of ES6, flexbox, bootstrap 4, etc. Is this course outdated at this point? Is there a more up to date full stack course you would recommend?", "score": 9, "comments": [{"body": "I'm sure there is but honestly I think you should try some courses that are more specific. You'll find alot better content from a course that just focuses on one language. The creator will also be more likely to keep that course up to date like the advanced sass course started with older methods off using css. Now the course has a section for flexbox and grid both like 2 hours long making 2 different websites. ", "id": "e4socph", "replies": []}, {"body": "It's good but I would call it outdated. You have so much more courses from late 2017 that are very good on udemy", "id": "e4t5138", "replies": []}, {"body": "Any course that is 2 years old will have a lot of outdated stuff in it. It may still be useful but it may not be worth getting into especially for technologies that move fast and introduce breaking changes.\n\nAny React course that is 1+ years old is severely outdated because that's when React 15 was introduced which changed the syntax and ways of doing stuff.\n\nSame thing with Express 3 to Express 4. \n\nThere is no lack of latest stuff for web development that is high quality too, so no need to spend time getting frustrated in outdated courses.", "id": "e4tt607", "replies": []}], "title": "Is Colt Steele\u2019s Web Developer Bootcamp outdated?"}
