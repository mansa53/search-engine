The website can be accessed here\n\n[https://www.shafirpl.com/](https://www.shafirpl.com/)\n\nThe problem is when I load the page on my iPhone(including both chrome and safari) or in desktop environments(such as MacBook) the background image shows up. However, on an android phone (tested with pixel xl and Samsung galaxy s8+) the background image doesn't show up. Which is even more strange is that I used chrome in my iPhone 7 plus, in which the background image loaded up perfectly, but using same chrome browser on pixel xl won't load the background image.\n\nI have included my relevant part of HTML and CSS code. The website is being served using express server(node js), and I used bootstrap as well as my own CSS\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is the css file\n\n    body{ background: url(/images/image3.jpg); \n    background-size: cover; \n    background-position: center; \n    font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif; \n    color: orange; }\n    \n    #content{\n      text-align: center;\n    \n      /* This will bring down the content to the middle of the page\n       Instead of giving a hard number, using percentage will make it more responsive, since\n      it will resize the padding to 25% according to the screen view or\n      avialable screen area */\n    \n      padding-top: 25%;\n    \n      /* This will set the blur effect */\n      text-shadow: 0px 4px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4),\n                   0px 8px 13px rgba(0,0,0,0.1),\n                   0px 18px 23px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\n    }\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is the ejs/html code\n\n    <!DOCTYPE html>\n    <html>\n      <head>\n        <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n        <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\n        <title>Shafi</title>\n    \n        <!-- This is the google font lato -->\n        <link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:400,700\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n    \n        <!-- Bootstrap Cdn -->\n        <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css\"\n        integrity=\"sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\">\n    \n    \n    \n        <!-- This is our own style sheet, we are adding it after bootstrap so that\n        it has highest precedence compared to bootstrap, remember\n        in css, the one comes late has more precedence -->\n        <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/stylesheets/homepage.css\">\n    \n        <!-- Fontawesome cdn -->\n        <link href=\"https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.2.0/css/all.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n    \n      </head>\n    \n      <body>\n    \n        <!-- The navbar -->\n        <nav class=\"navbar navbar-inverse\">\n      <div class=\"container\">\n        <!-- Brand and toggle get grouped for better mobile display -->\n        <div class=\"navbar-header\">\n          <button type=\"button\" class=\"navbar-toggle collapsed\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-target=\"#bs-example-navbar-collapse-1\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n            <span class=\"sr-only\">Toggle navigation</span>\n            <span class=\"icon-bar\"></span>\n            <span class=\"icon-bar\"></span>\n            <span class=\"icon-bar\"></span>\n          </button>\n          <a class=\"navbar-brand\" href=\"/\">Shafi</a>\n        </div>\n    \n        <!-- Collect the nav links, forms, and other content for toggling -->\n        <div class=\"collapse navbar-collapse\" id=\"bs-example-navbar-collapse-1\">\n          <ul class=\"nav navbar-nav\">\n            <!-- This active class will make the home appear highlighted or active -->\n            <li class=\"active\"><a href=\"/\">Home</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"/about\">About Me</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"/experience\">Work Experience</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"/protfolio\">Protfolio</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"/education\">Education</a></li>\n    \n          </ul>\n          <ul class=\"nav navbar-nav navbar-right\">\n            <li><a href=\"/resume\" target=\"_blank\"><i class=\"fas fa-file\"></i> My Resume </a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"/contact\"><i class=\"fas fa-envelope\"></i> Contact</a></li>\n          </ul>\n        </div><!-- /.navbar-collapse -->\n      </div><!-- /.container-fluid -->\n    </nav>\n    \n    \n    \n        <!-- This is for the background image -->\n        <div class=\"container\">\n          <div class=\"row\">\n            <div class=\"col-lg-12\">\n    \n              <!-- Centering everything with this div -->\n                <div id=\"content\">\n                  <h1>Hello World!

The `background-size: cover;` was causing the background to disapear on Android. I added `background-repeat: no-repeat;` and that fixed the issue\u200b\n\nIf you run into a problem like this again then it is possible to link your android device to chrome on your computer and play around with the css like that to see what is causing the problem.
