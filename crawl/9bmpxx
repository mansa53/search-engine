You didn't mention what you're into so my suggestions might not be that great.\n\n* Implement a concurrent stack with push/pop functionality\n* Override new and delete and implement your own concurrent allocation scheme\n* Implement your own version of Boost's lockfree::queue or a C++ version of Java's ConcurrentLinkedQueue\n* Write a C++ version of Java's ConcurrentHashMap\n* Create a concurrent job scheduler (job = std::function) where jobs can submit other jobs and wait for them to complete without causing deadlock, even if there is only a single thread running the jobs\n\nMost of these will require a fair amount of research but they'll teach you a lot.", "id": "e54mchy", "replies": [{"body": "these sound so cool!
