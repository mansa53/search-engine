I am stuck on this one problem:  We have a loud talking parrot. The \"hour\" parameter is the current hour time in the range 0..23. We are in trouble if the parrot is talking and the hour is before 7 or after 20. Return True if we are in trouble.\n\nMy code was:  def parrot\\_trouble(talking, hour):\n\n  if hour > 7 and talking == True:\n\nreturn True\n\n  elif hour < 20 and talking == True:\n\nreturn True \n\n  else: \n\nreturn False\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy code fails on parrot\\_trouble(True, 7) and parrot\\_trouble(True, 20) but passes other tests.\n\nMy question is why does it fail on these two tests? \n\n  \n", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "Four spaces for formatting.\n\nWhat happens if I pass 20 as my hour?  What does the question state about the range we are covering?  What happens if I pass 7 as my hour?  What the question state SPECIFICALLY about 7?  What does your code do?\n\nThat should help.\n\nAlso, you can merge the first two if statements as one bigger if statement.\n", "id": "e5at1ne", "replies": [{"body": "Thanks, that really helped me solve it.", "id": "e5atjgy", "replies": []}]}], "title": "Parrot Problem"}
