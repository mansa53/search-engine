It's just that you likely won't get around node if you want to get serious because most tools used in webdev nowadays (at least in front end) run on node. As far as the backend is concerned, if you already know js then node+express would be the obvious choice but there's also ruby on rails (I think it's dying though), pythons django or flask, php (even though the language is a mess) and various frameworks on the jvm or even as low level as rust's actix. \n\nI don't work in webdev though, At most I do some hobby level stuff with django.
