You'll learn far more from that than from doing exercises.\n\nI have to warn you, though, that there are very few entry-level jobs for C++ programmers who don't have a C.S. degree. C++ is more of a low-level language that's used to solve more difficult problems when other languages aren't up to the task. It's really hard to dive into that type of work if you haven't taken courses in computer architecture, operating systems, and so on.\n\nIn comparison, there are tons of jobs for JavaScript and Python programmers that are extremely entry-level, because those languages are often used to make really simple web sites and there's still a lot of demand for people who can do some rather simple programming and grow from there.\n\nI'm not trying to scare you away from C++, I just want to give you more realistic expectations.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "e5d3kok", "replies": []}, {"body": "> Hi everyone, I just finished learning the basic stuff for C++ like array vectors loops classes pointers etc. Problem is i feel like I am no where near the level that companies want from me\n\nIf you want to work as a C++ developer then you need to have real life skills in using that language. Examples include:\n\n* Learn Qt. It's a popular framework for building desktop/mobile applications (examples include Battle.net client, WPSOffice and TeamSpeak). Eventually build a copy of Paint in it for instance. \n* Or look into microcontrollers and the like - Arduino offers support to C++. You can find decent starting kits for ~100\u20ac (by decent I mean good enough to play with - with some engines, thermometers, a text display, buttons etc). In that case entry level experience would be writing code for things like alarm systems, a programmable joystick, brightness detector etc. \n* Game development is an option too. In this case your best bet would be starting to use Unreal Engine (as it uses C++), you can look into Allegro or SFML as well (those are smaller game development libraries but with some work you can for instance make a mario clone).\n\nBasically start focusing on real life skills. Barely knowing a language syntax is nowhere close. It's like being able to draw some lines vs a professional artist.  Somewhere along the way you will also want to learn about algorithms and data structures, I find [this book](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms) to be a really good introduction (one chapter is available for free so you can see if you find it readable).", "id": "e5d3n4c", "replies": []}, {"body": "Take what you\u2019ve learned and make a small project out of it.
