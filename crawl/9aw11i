However, I have a problem that I can't find any suitable word for \"class\", which is a place where students study, because \"class\" is a reserved word as Class in the most programming languages. As a result, I've been trying to find words which can be a substitute for \"class\" but I haven't\n\nDo you guys have any ideas about it?\n\nSorry about grammatic mistakes in my question.\nThank you\n", "score": 2, "comments": [{"body": "Nearly every programming language has \"reserved words\", which are words that are significant or important in the programming language and aren't allowed to be used as the names of classes, variables, or functions/methods. In many languages, \"class\" is one of those.\n\nThere are many common solutions:\n\n* Use a synonym, like: classroom, schoolroom, course, hall - use a thesaurus\n* Add another word to class to describe \\*which\\* class is relevant to your code, or the purpose of the variable. for example: myClass, firstClass, ClassInfo, UniversityClass\n* Add an underscore, like class\\_ or \\_class", "id": "e4yjokk", "replies": [{"body": "Thank you so much for teaching me :)\nI learned a lot from you.", "id": "e4yjucz", "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Normally, reserved words are not capitalized, i.e. class.

The fact that \"class\" is a programming concept as well as a concept of your business domain (e.g. a classroom) is probably the actual problem.
