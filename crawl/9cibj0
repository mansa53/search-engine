I keep getting to System files and getting an unauthorized error. My question is, should I ignore these files, I don't really intend on doing anything more than just looking  with this program. Or should I find a way around this, and do the searches anyway? For those that know C# I have tried to add a try catch block that caught the unauthorized error, but it ignores it and throws the exception anyway, how do I implement this properly?", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "I don't think you should move system files.\nDon't run your program as admin.\n\nI'd be interested in seeing the code for the exception that's caught, then rethrown.\nIn any case, you should handle the situation without it throwing an exception", "id": "e5aydst", "replies": [{"body": "I\u2019ll post the code later, I just don\u2019t understand the logic in how to get C# to ignore system files.", "id": "e5aynae", "replies": [{"body": "Try File.GetAttributes (filePath)\n\nIf it returns/contains FileAttributes.System, skip it", "id": "e5ayuhi", "replies": []}]}]}], "title": "Should I ignore these folders in my search program, or find a way to search them?
