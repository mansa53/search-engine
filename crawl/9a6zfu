I copied the example from the site and it worked but I noticed netbeans was giving a warning upon investigating, it landed me [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19767894/warning-do-not-access-superglobal-post-array-directly-on-netbeans-7-4-for-ph#19874791). Basically netbeans was telling me to use filter_input() function to remove potential malicious inputs and the solution i got,\n\nuse `filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'var_name')` instead of `$_POST['var_name']`\n\nAlthough this issue is covered in w3schools, after a chapter, their approach is different they did\n\n    <?php\n    // define variables and set to empty values\n    $name = $email = $gender = $comment = $website = \"\";\n\n    if ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n      $name = test_input($_POST[\"name\"]);\n      $email = test_input($_POST[\"email\"]);\n      $website = test_input($_POST[\"website\"]);\n      $comment = test_input($_POST[\"comment\"]);\n      $gender = test_input($_POST[\"gender\"]);\n    }\n    \n    function test_input($data) {\n      $data = trim($data);\n      $data = stripslashes($data);\n      $data = htmlspecialchars($data);\n      return $data;\n    }\n    ?>\n\nBut netbeans is still not happy about using the $_SERVER *also the $_POST* variable directly.\n\nI want to know if both these approaches achieve the same thing or if one is better than other in any way.\n\nEDIT highlighted in italics", "score": 1, "comments": [{"body": "These approaches **do not** achieve the same thing.\n\nYou should reread your post as your post says the difference. \n\nNetbeans cannot know that you\u2019re running validation and sanitization on the variables before using them.
