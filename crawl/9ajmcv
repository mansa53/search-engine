Wasn\u2019t too hard to get into an internship. Got my first one four months into the program but I think it was also my side projects and how I marketed myself that helped too. I think a combination of these would help. For the marketing part I used craigslist and posted how I was interested in any internship/freelance/entry level jobs.

The course material at WGU so far can vary in terms of how good they are. The software 1 class material wasn't that great as it was supposed to set me up to take a certification test but to pass the class I needed to just make a project", "id": "e4xgm1x", "replies": []}]}]}], "title": "How hard would it be to get an internship whilst attending an online degree?
