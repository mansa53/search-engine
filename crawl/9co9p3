With different types of people also come different motivations. I have helped people in CS courses to understand programming fundamentals and had fun doing that. I am planning to set this up bigger (don't hold me accountable, just a thought) and want to understand the motivation of people who want to learn programming.\n\nSo this is my question to you. What is your motivation to learn to program? What do you hope to achieve? Better job? Have an idea you want to turn into a product? I'd love to hear.", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "* It's fun seeing how the things that we use every day work, or at least you can start to grasp how things might have been designed.  I personally found an architecture course I took to be really interesting.  \n\n* It's fun to be able to understand what others are doing when it comes to programming, especially when it comes to emerging stuff.  I think this might be my favourite thing - the sense of \"holy shit I actually understand enough in this field to make sense of what this person is saying\" is, IMO, great.\n\n* Gives me an excuse to mess around with tech.\n\n* Decent job opportunities.", "id": "e5c2w3b", "replies": [{"body": "I see where you are coming from, many of those ring true in what I experience in programming. It is actually funny that you mention the architecture course (although I assume it's IT architecture). I feel that building software very much resembles building a house. All these objects that need to interact with each other and different rooms have different purposes. Takes planning, execution, measuring and testing.", "id": "e5c4p92", "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, it was revolving around CPU architecture.  We studied a MIPS CPU.\n\nShame the course got kinda downgraded; prior versions had you actually building some of the components.", "id": "e5c6kce", "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I'm tired of working in a warehouse, I want to do something that I like and that actually requires using grey matter", "id": "e5c44x7", "replies": [{"body": "Is liking programming something you want to explore, or do you already know you will like it due to some previous experience?", "id": "e5c4kro", "replies": [{"body": "I'm studying web development and so far it's very challenging, a lot of fun and fascinating. I don't have any previous experience but I love studying it and I will do this for a living. Because I'm done with stupid jobs with no escape and career opportunities.\nWhy programming and not something else? \nFor the money, the numerous possibilities in choosing a location, the fact that you can do it at home if really want. I don't want to be tied down to a place, if one day I decide to move to russia or china or finland or Canada, I'm sure I'll find a job. Also, being skilled in using a technology that's changing everything, from ai to medicine to our currency. An industry that is growing, I don't want to change my path again in 5 or 20 years because there's no jobs in the field. A big plus for me, being a father and husband with a job, is that this job does not require a stupidly expensive degree from fancy universities. I can learn from my desk with a crappy laptop. \nLearning to code, whatever the language, is learning a new way of thinking and I believe that it opens up a lot of possibilities, not only in web development.", "id": "e5cca4w", "replies": []}]}]}], "title": "Why do you want to learn to program?"}
