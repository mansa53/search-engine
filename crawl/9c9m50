We all gave answers except him. He just told us that we should study it and try to find out. Now unless I don't understand this, since a bit vector uses ones and zeros, wouldnt it just be the same as the int? 4 bytes?\n\nIs this some sort of trick question or do but vectors have a different size from ints? I did some Google searching and couldn't find a conclusive result?", "score": 0, "comments": [{"body": "A bit vector (or bit map, or bit array) is used to compactly store bits. It is a data structure where you care about individual bits instead of entire bytes or words.
