Can I prevent this from happening automatically?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's the basic code I'm using:\n\n        @IBOutlet weak var webview: WKWebView!\n        \n        override func viewDidLoad() {\n            super.viewDidLoad()\n            \n            let url = URL(string: \"https://www.utep.edu/liberalarts/music/\")\n            let request = URLRequest(url: url!)\n            webview.load(request)\n        }\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!", "score": 1, "comments": [], "title": "Prevent webkit view from allowing videos going fullscreen automatically?"}
